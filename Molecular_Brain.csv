Increasing evidence has highlighted their involvement in age-related neuroinflammation, where their dysfunction may contribute to sustained inflammatory states associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we compared inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary cerebral pericytes from neonatal and adult mice and adult humans. Our findings indicate that neonatal mouse pericytes display heightened inflammatory activation, with elevated levels of ICAM-1 and several cytokines, compared to adult mouse pericytes reflecting a more reactive phenotype. In contrast, adult mouse pericytes exhibited a significantly reduced cytokine release profile, suggesting lower responsiveness. Notably, while cytokine secretion patterns in adult human pericytes, in part, mirrored those in neonatal mouse pericytes, nitric oxide production, which was observed in mouse pericytes, was absent in the human cells. These results underscore species- and age-dependent variations in cellular behavior, emphasizing the importance of utilizing human brain cell systems when conducting research on neuroinflammation. Understanding these distinctions is vital for designing accurate studies and developing targeted therapies for neuroinflammatory conditions.","Pericytes, Inflammation, Aging, Central nervous system",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01209-7,2025
Divergent disruptive effects of soluble recombinant tau assemblies on synaptic plasticity in vivo,"Yin Yang1,2 na1,, Tomas Ondrejcak2 na1,, Neng-Wei Hu1,2,, Igor Klyubin2 &, Michael J. Rowan2","Neng-Wei Hu, Michael J. Rowan","hunw@tcd.ie, mrowan@tcd.ie",2025-04-18,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein fibrils, together with brain inflammation and synaptic loss, are neuropathological hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Compared with tau fibrils, more water-soluble assemblies of either recombinant or patient-derived tau have been reported to exert relatively potent rapid synaptotoxic effects, including inhibition of synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Less is known regarding the action of exogenous tau soluble assemblies on the opposite form of synaptic plasticity, long-term depression (LTD). We compared the synaptic plasticity actions of two relatively standard preparations of soluble recombinant tau assemblies, (i) fibril-derived soluble sonicated tau aggregates (SτAs) and (ii) oligomer-enriched tau (oTau) prepared from monomers. Consistent with previous findings, intracerebroventricular injections of either SτAs or oTau acutely inhibited high-frequency stimulation-induced LTP at CA3-to-CA1 synapses in the anaesthetized rat hippocampus. However, LTP inhibition by oTau, but not SτAs, was prevented by co-injection with the conformational anti-tau monoclonal antibody, TOMA1. Furthermore, in contrast to SτAs, which inhibited LTD, injection of oTau potently facilitated LTD, decreasing the threshold for LTD induction by low-frequency stimulation. To test the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mediating the disruptive effects of the two forms of soluble tau on synaptic plasticity we pre-injected etanercept, a decoy receptor for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Etanercept reduced the disruption of synaptic plasticity by oTau but not by SτAs. Moreover, injection of exogenous TNFα mimicked the facilitation of LTD by oTau, consistent with a role of this pro-inflammatory cytokine in LTD facilitation.These data provide evidence that preparations of soluble tau containing either monomer- or fibril-derived assemblies disrupt LTP and LTD via different mechanisms. Intriguingly, when oTau and SτAs were applied together, LTD block predominated. Thus, if similar synaptotoxic soluble tau assemblies are present together later during the disease process, as seems likely, inhibition of synaptic weakening processes is predicted to predominate. Equally, reducing TNFα would be expected to be more effective when the monomer-derived soluble tau assemblies are the dominant synaptotoxic species. We conclude that oTau and SτAs provide useful means to explore ways of targeting different synaptotoxic soluble tau species in tauopathies.","Alzheimer’s disease, Recombinant tau, Tumor necrosis factor (alpha), Long-term potentiation, Long-term depression, Synaptic plasticity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01208-8,2025

The vaccine strain of Pseudorabies virus (PRV, Bartha strain) can infect neurons and spread in a retrograde manner in the neural circuit. In this study, we engineered the genome of PRV Bartha strain to prepare two new tracers, PRV676 and PRV829, by replacing the TK gene of PRV with the Cre-dependent expression cassette of the fluorescent protein gene and the TK gene. These two tracers can separately and Cre-dependently express EGFP and mRuby3 and produce progeny viruses in vitro and in vivo, which can help to map the multilevel inputs of a specific neuronal subpopulation expressing Cre.

Comparative experience shapes sucrose preference through memory in Drosophila,"Maximiliano Martinez-Cordera1,2,, Takaomi Sakai2,, Minoru Saitoe1 &, Kohei Ueno1",Kohei Ueno,ueno-kh@igakuken.or.jp,2025-04-10,"Selection of appropriate food is an ability that allows animals to make optimal foraging choices. However, the neural mechanisms that control this food selection remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the connection between memory and the feeding behavior of Drosophila melanogaster when two sucrose solutions with different concentrations are available. We placed flies into plates with 150 mM and 100 mM sucrose solutions and measured the preference for the 150 mM one. Flies preferred the 150 mM solution over the 100 mM when all 60 wells of the plate were filled with both solutions; this preference decreased when there were only 8 wells with food. Remarkably, prior exposure to a plate with all 60 wells filled with both solutions enhanced the preference for the 150 mM, even when there were only 8 wells with food. We found that the memory-related gene rut and the dopamine D1 receptor on the mushroom body were required to enhance the preference after the prior exposure. These findings show that memory acquired through experiencing both solutions is stored in the mushroom body optimizing the food selection process.","Drosophila melanogaster, Feeding behavior, Sucrose preference, Mushroom body, Dopamine signaling",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01202-0,2025

Fear memory recall reactivates the consolidated fear memory trace across multiple brain regions, and several studies have suggested that these recall-activated neurons are re-engaged during extinction. However, the molecular mechanisms linking this reactivation to extinction remain largely elusive. Here, we investigated the role of N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in remote memory recall–activated neurons within the basolateral amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex during extinction training in mice. We found that Grin1 knockdown in these specific ensembles impaired extinction of remote fear memory, but did not reduce their reactivation during retrieval of the extinguished memory. These data suggest that while reactivation of these neuronal populations persists, their NMDARs are crucial for driving the synaptic plasticity needed to extinguish remote fear memories.","Remote fear memory extinction, Recall-activated neurons, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01203-z,2025

Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger neuronal damage and may induce disulfidptosis—a novel cell death modality not yet characterized in PD pathogenesis.MethodIntegrated bioinformatics analyses were conducted using GEO datasets to identify PD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These datasets were subjected to: immune infiltration analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), intersection analysis of oxidative stress-related genes (ORGs) and disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) for functional enrichment annotation. Following hub gene identification, diagnostic performance was validated using independent cohorts. LASSO regression was applied for feature selection, with subsequent experimental validation in MPTP-induced PD mouse models. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and molecular docking studies were performed to map target gene expression and assess drug-target interactions.ResultA total of 1615 PD DEGs and 200 WGCNA DEGs were obtained, and the intersection with ORGs and DRGs resulted in 202 DEORGs, 11 DEDRGs, and 5 DED-ORGs (NDUFS2, LRPPRC, NDUFS1, GLUD1, and MYH6). These genes are mainly associated with oxidative stress, the respiratory electron transport chain, the ATP metabolic process, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial respiration, and the TCA cycle. 10 hub genes have good diagnostic value, including in the validation dataset (AUC ≥ 0.507). LASSO analysis of hub genes yielded a total of 6 target genes, ACO2, CYCS, HSPA9, SNCA, SDHA, and VDAC1. In the MPTP-induced PD mice model, the expression of ACO2, HSPA9, and SDHA was decreased while the expression of CYCS, SNCA, and VDAC1 was increased, and the expression of the 5 DED-ORGs was decreased. Additionally, it was discovered that N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibit the occurrence of disulfidptosis in the MPTP-induced PD model. Subsequently, the distribution of target genes with AUC > 0.7 in different cell types of the brain was analyzed. Finally, molecular docking was performed between the anti-PD drugs entering clinical phase IV and the target genes. LRPPRC has low binding energy and strong affinity with duloxetine and donepezil, with binding energies of -7.6 kcal/mol and − 8.7 kcal/mol, respectively.ConclusionThis study elucidates the pathogenic role of OS-induced disulfidptosis in PD progression. By identifying novel diagnostic biomarkers (e.g., DED-ORGs) and therapeutic targets (e.g., LRPPRC), our findings provide a mechanistic framework for PD management and lay the groundwork for future therapeutic development.","Parkinson’s disease, Oxidative stress, Disulfidptosis, Mitochondria",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01200-2,2025
Ultrastructural characterization of peri-synaptic astrocytic processes around cerebellar Purkinje spines under resting and stimulated conditions,Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng1,Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng,chengs@ninds.nih.gov,2025-03-31,"In mammalian brains, astroglia presence near glutamatergic excitatory synapses has generated the term “tripartite” junctions, based on the close association of astrocytic processes near the active zone formed by presynaptic axonal terminal and postsynaptic dendritic spines. One major function of these astrocytic processes is to take up glutamate that spill out of the synaptic cleft during activity, via glutamate transporters located on astroglial plasma membrane. Comapred to other regions of the brain, the cerebellar Purkinje spines in the molecular layer are virtually completely ensheathed by Bergman glia, a special type of astrocyte, unique to cerebellum. The present electron microscopy study classifies these peri-synaptic astrocytic processes (PAP) ensheathing the Purkinje spine synapses into three types based on structural criteria: (1) Type 1– astrocytic process is situated at the edge of the synaptic cleft immediately next to the synaptic active zone. Under fast perfusion fixation conditions where synapses were under resting states, ~ 58% of the PAP’s were scored as Type 1. The occurrence frequency of Type 1 PAP significantly decreased to 25% upon a 5–8 min delay in perfusion fixation, where synapses were under stimulated states. (2) Type 2– astrocytic process covers part of the postsynaptic membrane containing the postsynaptic density (PSD), so that this part of the PSD is separated from its presynaptic terminal. Occurrence frequency of Type 2 PAP’s significantly increased from ~ 14% under fast perfusion fixation to 31% upon delayed perfusion fixation, and the average length of the PSD edge covered by astroglia increased from 41 nm to 57 nm upon delayed perfusion fixation. (3) Type 3– astrocytic process is situated some distance away from the active zone, while the presynaptic axon terminal extends to enwrap the spine beyond the active zone. Occurrence frequency of Type 3 PAP’s increased from 28 to 43% upon delayed perfusion fixation, and the average length between apposed axon terminal and spine beyond the synaptic cleft significantly increased from 98 to 209 nm upon delayed perfusion fixation. Thus, upon stimulation, the tripartite synaptic junctions undergo dynamic structural changes with the astrocytic processes moving into the open cleft to cover the exposed postsynaptic membrane containing PSD, the presynaptic axon terminals extending to wrap the postsynaptic spine beyond the synaptic cleft. Both structural changes may facilitate glutamate uptake to clear the transmitter spilled out from the synaptic cleft during intense activity and prevent damage from overstimulation.","Tripartite synapses, Electron microscopy, Astrocyte, Purkinje spines, Glutamate uptake, Glutamate transporter, Synaptic cleft",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01198-7,2025

These neurons were next exposed to pre-aggregated β-amyloid 1–42 oligomers to model the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Our data reveal that upregulation of KLOTHO significantly reduced β-amyloid-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression and preservation of axonal integrity. Additionally, KLOTHO overexpression prevented the loss of dendritic branching and mitigated reductions in axonal diameter, hallmark features of neurodegenerative pathology.

Examination of cognitive ability and mood regulation next day of the termination of stress showed normal hippocampal function in mice deficient of Atg7. However, it was not investigated whether the preservation of NSC pool alleviates hippocampal neuronal alterations. Here, we show that CRS increased c-Fos-positive, activated neurons in the granule cell layer and decreased spine density of CA3 neurons in the hippocampus, and these hippocampal neuronal deficits were prevented by NSC-specific deletion of Atg7. Of note, our observation was conducted right after the termination of CRS.

Scholl1,2",Francisco G. Scholl,fgs@us.es,2025-03-14,"Neurexins are presynaptic plasma membrane proteins that regulate key aspects of synapse physiology through the formation of transcellular complexes with postsynaptic ligands, including neuroligins (Nlgns). Each neurexin gene (NRXN1-3) generates two main alternative-spliced transcripts that generate alpha and beta-Nrxn isoforms differing in their extracellular domains. Mutations in NRXN1 are associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, whether dysfunction of NRXN1 occurs through common or isoform-specific postsynaptic partners for alpha- and beta-Nrxn1 is not completely known. The association of Nrxn1 proteins with postsynaptic partners has been mostly analysed in experiments that test binding, but Nrxn proteins must interact with Nlgns in opposing cells, which requires transcellular oligomerization. Here, we studied the interactions of Nrxn1/Nlgn pairs across the synapse and identified the type of association affected in a mouse model of autism. We found that beta-Nrxn1 can be recruited at synaptic contacts by glutamatergic Nlgn1 and GABAergic Nlgn2, whereas alpha-Nrxn1 is a presynaptic partner of Nlgn2. Insertion of alternative spliced segment 4 (AS4) negatively modulates the presynaptic recruitment of Nrxn1 by Nlgns.

Here, we established an innovative method, based on viral vectors, which utilizes the endogenous biogenesis of neurotrophins to deliver and express a biologically active peptide to attenuate specifically ERK1/2 nuclear functions in specific brain area of the adult forebrain. In contrast to our hypothesis, nuclear functions of ERK1/2 in the forebrain are fundamental for the extinction of associative-aversive memories, but not for acquisition, nor for retrieval of these memories.

The limbic thalamus controls cognitive function in concert with interconnected cortical and limbic structures. Though medial prefrontal (mPFC) afferents to the limbic thalamus regulate aversive memory, the functional role of limbic thalamus efferents to mPFC is unclear. Here, we investigated the roles of thalamic nuclei, the reuniens (RE) and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in aversive memory conditioning and extinction in male mice. Using retrograde tracing, we demonstrated that ventromedial PFC (vmPFC)- and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC)-projecting neurons are topologically segregated within the RE and MD. Fiber photometry revealed that both RE→vmPFC and MD→vmPFC neurons respond to aversive stimuli. Notably, RE→vmPFC neurons develop shock-associated cue (CS+) response during aversive conditioning. During extinction, RE→vmPFC neurons exhibited a biphasic response to CS+, while MD→vmPFC neurons showed no cue-evoked activity. Neither optogenetic activation nor inactivation of these populations altered freezing behavior during extinction compared to controls. Collectively, these findings indicate that RE→vmPFC neurons encode aversive cue information during extinction but are dispensable for behavioral modulation.

We investigated its role in contextual fear conditioning and extinction of conditioned fear using Trpm2-deficient (Trpm2−/−) mice. Trpm2−/− mice exhibited reduced acquisition of contextual fear memory during conditioning but had an intact freezing response to conditioning context 24 h after conditioning. They also showed a reduced freezing response to extinction training, indicating facilitated extinction. Consistent with this, infusion of flufenamic acid (FFA), a TRPM2 antagonist, into the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in fear-conditioned mice facilitated extinction of contextual fear. The enhanced extinction in Trpm2−/− and FFA-treated mice was associated with down-regulation of immediate-early genes (IEGs) including Npas4, c-Fos, Arc and Egr1 in the hippocampus after extinction training. Our results indicate that TRPM2 plays a positive role in retention of contextual fear memory by modulating neuronal activity in the hippocampus, and suggest that TRPM2 activity could potentially be targeted to strengthen extinction-based exposure therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).","Transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2), Extinction, Fear memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01181-2,2025

However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the expression of OF-related activity in the ACC remain unexplored. Previous studies have shown that the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is crucial for OF, and MD neurons project to the ACC. Therefore, we hypothesize that the projection from MD to ACC may facilitate the OF-related activity in the ACC. By utilizing in vivo calcium imaging combined with the optogenetic terminal inhibition of MD-ACC pathway, we found that a subset of ACC neurons was activated when observing demonstrator’s fearful situation in male mice.

Post-CA brain injury (PCABI) is a major cause of death and poor recovery in CA patients and the current CA treatments are not very effective. The microbiome-gut-brain axis has been found to significantly affect brain ischemia injury. Furthermore, in ischemic stroke patients, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially sodium butyrate (SB), have been observed to promote neuroprotective effects by modulating inflammatory response and microglial polarization in the cortex. However, the precise mechanism of SB on CA-induced injury remains elusive. Therefore, this research study established an oxygen–glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model using BV-2 microglial and HT22 cells to simulate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro and a potassium chloride-induced CA mouse model to mimic CA in vivo. The data revealed that SB markedly improved neurological scores and reduced neuronal death and apoptosis. Moreover, it reduced M1 microglia and neuroinflammation in CA mice. In addition, SB increased intestinal integrity and alleviated systemic inflammation. The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that SB intervention mitigated CA-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and SCFA depletion. It was also observed that CA mice’s brain and OGD/R-exposed BV2 cells had substantially increased levels of MyD88, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and TLR4 proteins, which were reduced after SB treatment. In summary, this study revealed that SB can protect against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury by controlling microglia polarization and microbiome-gut-brain axis to inhibit brain inflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.","Cardiac arrest, Microglia, Sodium butyrate, TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, Neuroinflammation, Gut microbiota",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-025-01179-w,2025

This study revealed that the remodeling processes of veins differ from those of arteries after ischemia. Ligation of the right jugular vein increased the infarct volume, decreased cerebral blood flow and impaired long-term functional restoration after stroke. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant upregulation of the expression of genes associated with angiogenesis in the infarct core during the recovery period. By using gelatin ink-alkaline phosphatase-oil red O (GIAO) staining, we found that venogenesis, the process of creating new veins, was the predominant angiogenic event in the infarct core. Macrophage infiltration and transformation are closely associated with venogenesis in the infarct core. However, depletion of macrophages in the circulation by clodronate liposomes in the acute phase inhibited the proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells and decreased the vascular density in the infarct core. This study demonstrated that dynamic vein remodeling is crucial for cerebral ischemic damage and subsequent neuronal restoration.

Nek6 regulates autophagy through the mTOR signaling pathway to alleviate cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury,"Qingzhi Wang1,2,3,, Xinjing Liu1,2,3,, Jing Yuan1,2,3,, Ting Yang1,2,3,, Lan Ding1,2,3,, Bo Song1,2,3 &, Yuming Xu1,2,3",Yuming Xu,xuyuming@zzu.edu.cn,2024-12-19,"ObjectiveCerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a major obstacle to neurological recovery after clinical treatment of ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of Nek6 alleviating CIRI through autophagy after cerebral ischemia.Materials and methodsA mouse model of CIRI was constructed by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). TUNEL staining was used to observe the apoptosis of neuronal cells. The oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was established by hypoxia and reoxygenation. The cell apoptosis and activity was detected. Western blot was performed to detect the expression of autophagy-related proteins, protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins. Cellular autophagy flux was observed by fluorometric method. NIMA-related kinase 6 (Nek6) mRNA stability was detected by actinomycin D treatment. Methylation RNA immunoprecipitation technique was used to detect Nek6 methylation level.ResultsNek6 expression was increased in both MCAO and OGD/R models. Overexpression of Nek6 in OGD/R inhibited apoptosis, decreased LC3II and Beclin-1 expression, increased p62 expression, and occurred lysosome dysfunction. Interference with Nek6 has opposite results. Nek6 overexpression promoted p-Akt and p-mTOR protein expressions, inhibited p-AMPK and p-UNC-51-like kinase 1 protein expressions and cell apoptosis, while LY294002, Rapamycin or RSVA405 treatment reversed this effect. Abnormal methyltransferase·like protein 3 (METTL3) expression in CIRI enhanced m6A modification and promoted Nek6 expression level.ConclusionThis study confirmed that Nek6 regulates autophagy and alleviates CIRI through the mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with ischemic stroke in the future.","Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury, Autophagy, Nek6, mTOR signaling pathway",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01166-7,2024

However, in a small number of cases, mutant animal models display enhancements in specific behaviors such as learning and memory. To date, most gene deletions shown to enhance cognitive ability generally affect a limited number of pathways such as NMDA receptor- and translation-dependent plasticity, or GABA receptor- and potassium channel-mediated inhibition. While endolysosomal trafficking of AMPA receptors is a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity, mutations in genes that affect AMPAR trafficking either have no effect or are deleterious for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. NSG2 is one of the three-member family of Neuron-specific genes (NSG1-3), which have been shown to regulate endolysosomal trafficking of a number of proteins critical for neuronal function, including AMPAR subunits (GluA1-2). Based on these findings and the largely universal expression throughout mammalian brain, we predicted that genetic knockout of NSG2 would result in significant impairments across multiple behavioral modalities including motor, affective, and learning/memory paradigms. However, in the current study we show that loss of NSG2 had highly selective effects on associative learning and memory, leaving motor and affective behaviors intact. For instance, NSG2 KO animals performed equivalent to wild-type C57Bl/6n mice on rotarod and Catwalk motor tasks, and did not display alterations in anxiety-like behavior on open field and elevated zero maze tasks. However, NSG2 KO animals demonstrated enhanced recall in the Morris water maze, accelerated reversal learning in a touch-screen task, and accelerated acquisition and enhanced recall on a Trace Fear Conditioning task. Together, these data point to a specific involvement of NSG2 on multiple types of associative learning, and expand the repertoire of pathways that can be targeted for cognitive enhancement.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01158-7,2024

Understanding neural adaptation to novelty exposure therefore has therapeutic implications. Here, I found that novelty induces time-dependent theta (4-12Hz) oscillatory dynamics in brain circuits including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), as mice adapt to a novel environment. Local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed while mice were freely behaving in a novel or a familiar arena for 10 min. Initially, mice exhibited increased exploratory behavior upon exposure to novelty, which gradually decreased to levels observed in mice exposed to the familiar arena. Over the same time course, the mPFC, vHPC, and VTA displayed progressively increasing theta power through novelty exposure. Additionally, theta coherence and theta phase synchrony measures demonstrated that novelty weakened the connectivity between these areas, which then gradually strengthened to the level observed in the familiar group. Conversely, mice exposed to the familiar arena showed steady and consistent behavior as well as theta dynamics in all areas. Treatment with a dopamine D1-receptor (D1R) antagonist in the vHPC disrupted neurophysiological adaptation to novelty specifically in the vHPC-mPFC and vHPC-VTA circuits, without affecting behavior. Thus, novelty induces distinct theta dynamics that are not readily dictated by behavior in the mPFC, vHPC, and VTA circuits, a process mediated by D1Rs in the vHPC. The observed time-dependent circuit dynamics in the key learning and memory circuit would provide new insights for treating neuropsychiatric disorders that often show impaired novelty processing.","Novelty, Medial prefrontal cortex, Ventral hippocampus, Ventral tegmental area, Dopamine D1 receptor, Theta",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01167-6,2024

This study aimed to investigate the influence of serotonin on brain structure and hippocampal volumes in relation to cognitive functions in AD, as well as its link with biomarkers like CNTF, FGF-4, BMP-6, and MMP-1. Data from 133 ADNI participants with AD included cognitive assessments (CDR-SB), serotonin measurements (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit, UPLC-MS/MS), and neurotrophic factors quantified via multiplex proteomics. Gray matter volume changes were analyzed using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) with MRI. Statistical analyses employed Pearson correlation, bootstrap methods, and FDR-adjusted p-values (< 0.05 or < 0.01) via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, alongside nonparametric methods. The analysis found a positive correlation between serotonin levels and total brain (r = 0.229, p = 0.023) and hippocampal volumes (right: r = 0.186, p = 0.032; left: r = 0.210, p = 0.023), even after FDR adjustment. Higher serotonin levels were linked to better cognitive function (negative correlation with CDR-SB, r = −0.230, p = 0.024). Notably, serotonin levels were positively correlated with BMP-6 (r = 0.173, p = 0.047), CNTF (r = 0.216, p = 0.013), FGF-4 (r = 0.176, p = 0.043), and MMP-1 (r = 0.202, p = 0.019), suggesting a link between serotonin and neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. However, after adjusting for multiple comparisons and controlling for confounding factors such as age, gender, education, and APOE genotypes (APOE3 and APOE4), none of the correlations of biomarkers remained statistically significant. In conclusion, increased serotonin levels are associated with improved cognitive function and increased brain volume.

Comprehensive quantitative analysis of network activity changes at the neuronal ensembles level revealed highly stable neuronal activity parameters, which exhibited a rapid and robust shift in response to acute stress stimulation. This shift was accompanied by the restructuring of the pairwise-correlated neuronal pairs.

First, we generated a chronic TLE mouse model via initial intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) injection. In the chronic state after first IHKA injection, behavioral seizures and histological abnormalities were reliably observed. We then injected an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector carrying an inhibitory chemogenetic element, hM4Di, directly into the subiculum. Eight weeks after the first IHKA injection, acute seizures were induced by giving a second dose of kainic acid (KA), which mimicked generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Herein, precise control over generalized tonic–clonic seizure onset was achieved via this two-step process. We found that chemogenetic suppression of subicular pyramidal neurons had a robust anti-epileptogenesis effect in this acute-chronic model of TLE.

We investigated the three-way interaction between tests (trace vs. delay), sleep states, and sex during initial recall, extinction, and post-extinction remote recall. A six-hour post-conditioning sleep deprivation (SD) did not affect freezing behavior during the following day’s extinction training of delay fear memory. However, during post-extinction remote recall of delay fear memory, SD prevented spontaneous recovery in males and reduced persistent freezing in females. In contrast, SD rapidly facilitated extinction of trace fear memory. In summary, SD enhances extinction both in the short-term and long-term, depending on the conditioning protocol. These findings highlight the importance of long-term assessments to explore interactions among emotional memory, sleep, and sex differences, with implications for individualized mechanisms underlying post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its treatments.","Sleep deprivation, Learning & memory, Sex difference, Delay and trace auditory fear conditioning, Fear extinction and spontaneous recovery",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01163-w,2024

However, the presence of overlapping spikes, originating from neurons firing simultaneously or within a short delay, has been overlooked because of the difficulty in identifying individual neurons due to the lack of ground truth. In this study, we propose a method to identify overlapping spikes in extracellular recordings and to recover hidden spikes by decomposing them. We initially estimate spike waveform templates through a series of steps, including discriminative subspace learning and the isolation forest algorithm. By leveraging these estimated templates, we generate synthetic spikes and train a classifier using their feature components to identify overlapping spikes from observed spike data. The identified overlapping spikes are then decomposed into individual hidden spikes using a particle swarm optimization. Results from the testing of the proposed approach, using the simulation dataset we generated, demonstrated that employing synthetic spikes in the overlapping spike classifier accurately identifies overlapping spikes among the detected ones (the maximum F1 score of 0.88). Additionally, the approach can infer the synchronization between hidden spikes by decomposing the overlapped spikes and reallocating them into distinct clusters. This study advances spike sorting by accurately identifying overlapping spikes, providing a more precise tool for neural activity analysis.","Overlapping spikes, Synthetic data-driven approach, Spike sorting, Spike synchronization",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01161-y,2024

Therefore, H3 receptor inverse agonists/antagonists increase the synthesis and release of these neurotransmitters, enhancing cognitive functions, including memory consolidation and retrieval. Spontaneous neural activity across the cerebral cortex is essential for cognitive function, including memory consolidation. Abnormal spontaneous activity has, in fact, been associated with cognitive dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders. Given the cognitive improvement achieved with the use of H3 receptor inverse agonists/antagonists, we examined the effects of two inverse agonists/antagonists – thioperamide and pitolisant – on spontaneous cortical activity, using in vivo wide-field Ca2+ imaging. Changes in cortical activity, across multiple cortical regions and in inter-regional connectivity, from pre- to post-administration were evaluated using a linear support vector machine decoder. Thioperamide and pitolisant both modified the amplitude distribution of calcium events across multiple cortical regions, including a reduction in the frequency of low-amplitude calcium events in the somatosensory cortex. Graph theory analysis revealed increases in centrality measures in the somatosensory cortex with the use of both thioperamide and pitolisant, indicative of their importance in the organization of cortical networks.

Morrow,eric_morrow@brown.edu,2024-11-27,"Recessive loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase 2 (GPT2) cause intellectual disability in children. Given this cognitive disorder, and because glutamate metabolism is tightly regulated to sustain excitatory neurotransmission, here we investigate the role of GPT2 in synaptic function. GPT2 catalyzes a reversible reaction interconverting glutamate and pyruvate with alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle intermediate; thereby, GPT2 may play an important role in linking mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with synaptic transmission. In mouse brain, we find that GPT2 is enriched in mitochondria of synaptosomes (isolated synaptic terminals). Loss of Gpt2 in mouse appears to lead to reprogramming of glutamate and glutamine metabolism, and to decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in pyramidal neurons of CA1 hippocampal slices from Gpt2-null mice reveal decreased excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changes in mEPSC frequency, or importantly, changes in inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs). Additional evidence of defective glutamate release included reduced levels of glutamate released from Gpt2-null synaptosomes measured biochemically. Glutamate release from synaptosomes was rescued to wild-type levels by alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation. Additionally, we observed evidence of altered metabolism in isolated Gpt2-null synaptosomes: decreased TCA cycle intermediates, and increased glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Notably, alterations in the TCA cycle and the glutamine pool were alleviated by alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation. In conclusion, our data support a model whereby GPT2 mitochondrial activity may contribute to glutamate availability in pre-synaptic terminals, thereby highlighting potential interactions between pre-synaptic mitochondrial metabolism and synaptic transmission.","Neurometabolism, Glutamate, Synapse, TCA cycle, GPT2, Neurometabolic, Disease, Intellectual disability, Cognitive development",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01154-x,2024

The CACNA1A gene, encoding the Cav2.1 pore forming subunit, is highly expressed throughout the mammalian central nervous system. Alternative splicing of Cav2.1 pre-mRNA generates diverse channel isoforms with distinct biophysical properties and drug affinities, which are differentially expressed in nerve tissues. Splicing variants can also affect channel function under pathological conditions although their phenotypic implication concerning inherited neurological disorders linked to CACNA1A mutations remains unknown. Here, we quantified the expression of Cav2.1 exon 24 (e24) spliced transcripts in human nervous system samples, finding different levels of expression within discrete regions. The corresponding Cav2.1 variants, differing by the presence (+) or absence (Δ) of Ser-Ser-Thr-Arg residues (SSTR) in the domain III S3-S4 linker, were functionally characterized using patch clamp recordings. Further, the + /ΔSSTR isoforms were used to demonstrate the differential impact of the Familial Hemiplegic Migraine Type 1 (FHM-1) S218L mutation, located in the domain I S4-S5 linker, on the molecular structure and electrophysiological properties of Cav2.1 isoforms. S218L has a prominent effect on the voltage-dependence of activation of +SSTR channels when compared to ΔSSTR, indicating a differential effect of the mutation depending on splice-variant context. Structural modeling based upon Cav2.1 cryo-EM data provided further insight reflecting independent contributions of amino acids in distant regions of the channel on gating properties. Our modelling indicates that by increasing hydrophobicity the Leu218 mutation contributes to stabilizing a structural conformation in which the domain I S4-S5 linker is oriented alongside the inner plasma membrane, similar to that occurring when S4 is translocated upon activation.The SSTR insertion appears to exert an influence in the local electric field of domain III due to an change in the distribution of positively charged regions surrounding the voltage sensing domain, which we hypothesize impacts its movement during the transition to the open state. In summary, we reveal molecular changes correlated with distinct functional effects provoked by S218L FHM-1 mutation in hCav2.1 splice isoforms whose differential expression could impact the manifestation of the neurological disorder.","P/Q-type channel, FHM-1 mutation, Alternative splicing, Structural modeling, Gating",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01152-z,2024
NEK7 induces lactylation in Alzheimer’s disease to promote pyroptosis in BV-2 cells,"Jing Cheng1 &, Hui Zhao1",Hui Zhao,ZH0959@shtrhospital.com,2024-11-19,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by irreversible brain tissue degeneration. The amyloid-β (Aβ) cascade hypothesis stands as the predominant paradigm explaining AD pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Aβ-induced pyroptosis in AD. AD models were established using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice and Aβ-treated BV-2 cells (5 µM, 24 h). NEK7 expression was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell pyroptosis was assessed before and after NEK7 expression was inhibited in BV-2 cells. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against NEK7 (AAV-sh-NEK7) were administered to mice to knockdown NEK7 in vivo. Spatial learning and memory abilities were evaluated using the Morris water maze test. The interaction between NEK7 and histone H4 lysine 12 lactylation (H4K12la) were then investigated. The results suggested that NEK7 expression was markedly elevated in both in vitro and in vivo AD models. Treatment with Aβ significantly reduced cell viability and enhanced pyroptosis in BV-2 cells; these effects were reversed by inhibiting NEK7. Furthermore, AD mice with NEK7 knockdown exhibited shorter escape latencies and increased time spent in the target quadrant, suggesting that NEK7 inhibition improved cognitive function and memory retention. Mechanistically, Aβ treatment induced histone lactylation in BV-2 cells, and suppression of lactylation attenuated NEK7 transcriptional activity and mRNA levels. In summary, elevated NEK7 expression promoted histone lactylation in BV-2 cells, thereby facilitating pyroptosis. Inhibition of NEK7 conferred protection against Aβ-induced cellular damage and enhanced cognitive performance and memory retention in AD model mice. Collectively, targeting NEK7 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating AD symptoms.Graphical abstract","Alzheimer’s disease, NEK7, Pyroptosis, Lactylation, Aβ",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01156-9,2024

Exosomes are small (30 to 100 nm) membrane-bound extracellular vesicles released by most of the mammalian cells. Exosomes play a vital role in cell-to-cell communication. This includes regulation of inflammatory responses by shuttling mRNAs, miRNAs, and cytokines, both locally and systemically to the neighboring as well as distant cells to further modulate the transcriptional and/or translational states and affect the functional phenotype of those cells that have taken up these exosomes. The role of circulating blood exosomes leading to neuroinflammation during systemic inflammatory conditions was hereby characterized. Serum-derived exosomes from LPS-challenged mice (SDEL) were freshly isolated from the sera of the mice that were earlier treated with LPS and used to study the effects on neuroinflammation. Exosomes isolated from the sera of the mice injected with saline were used as a control. In-vitro studies showed that the SDEL upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the murine cell lines of microglia (BV-2), astrocytes (C8-D1A), and cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3). To further study their effects in-vivo, SDEL were intravenously injected into normal adult mice. Elevated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in the brains of SDEL recipient mice. Proteomic analysis of the SDEL confirmed the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in them. Together, these results demonstrate and strengthen the novel role of peripheral circulating exosomes in causing neuroinflammation during systemic inflammatory conditions.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01120-7,2024

Depression is associated with disturbances in the gut microbiota composition and peripheral and central energy metabolism. However, the relationship between chronic glucocorticoid exposure, the gut microbiota, and brain metabolism remains largely unknown. In this study, we first investigated the effects of chronic corticosterone exposure on various domains of behavior in adult male C57BL/6J mice treated with the glucocorticoid corticosterone to evaluate them as an animal model of depression. We then examined the gut microbial composition and brain and plasma metabolome in corticosterone-treated mice. Chronic corticosterone treatment resulted in reduced locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors, decreased rotarod latency, reduced acoustic startle response, decreased social behavior, working memory deficits, impaired contextual fear memory, and enhanced cued fear memory. Chronic corticosterone treatment also altered the composition of gut microbiota, which has been reported to be associated with depression, such as increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, Turicibacter, and Corynebacterium and decreased abundance of Barnesiella. Metabolomic data revealed that long-term exposure to corticosterone led to a decrease in brain neurotransmitter metabolites, such as serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, as well as changes in betaine and methionine metabolism, as indicated by decreased levels of adenosine, dimethylglycine, choline, and methionine in the brain. These results indicate that mice treated with corticosterone have good face and construct validity as an animal model for studying anxiety and depression with altered gut microbial composition and brain metabolism, offering new insights into the neurobiological basis of depression arising from gut-brain axis dysfunction caused by prolonged exposure to excessive glucocorticoids.","Corticosterone, Anxiety, Depression, Behavior, Gut microbiome, Metabolome, Mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01146-x,2024

Synaptic profiles were sampled from stratum pyramidale and radiatum of the CA1 region from (1) perfusion fixed mouse brains, (2) immersion fixed rat organotypic slice cultures, and from (3) rat dissociated hippocampal cultures of mixed cell types. Synapses were stimulated in the brain by a 5 min delay in perfusion fixation to trigger an ischemia-like excitatory condition, and by treating the two culture systems with 90 mM high K+ for 2–3 min to depolarize the neurons. Upon such stimulation conditions, the presynaptic terminals of the inhibitory synapses exhibited similar structural changes to those seen in glutamatergic excitatory synapses, with depletion of synaptic vesicles, increase of clathrin-coated vesicles and appearance of synaptic spinules. However, in contrast to excitatory synapses, no structural differences were detected in the postsynaptic compartment of the inhibitory synapses upon stimulation. There were no changes in the appearance of material associated with the postsynaptic membrane or the length and curvature of the membrane. Also no change was detected in the labeling density of gephyrin, a GABAergic synaptic marker, lining the postsynaptic membrane. Furthermore, virtually all inhibitory synaptic clefts remained rigidly apposed, unlike in the case of excitatory synapses where ~ 20–30% of cleft edges were open upon stimulation, presumably to facilitate the clearance of neurotransmitters from the cleft. The fact that no open clefts were induced in inhibitory synapses upon stimulation suggests that inhibitory input may not need to be toned down under these conditions. On the other hand, similar to excitatory synapse, EGTA (a calcium chelator) induced open clefts in ~ 18% of inhibitory synaptic cleft edges, presumably disrupting similar calcium-dependent trans-synaptic bridges in both types of synapses.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01151-0,2024

The endogenous coupling between the amplitude of gamma oscillations and the phase of theta oscillations is crucial for cognitive control. Theta/gamma peak-coupled transcranial alternating current stimulation (TGCp-tACS) can modulate this coupling and thus influence WM performance. This study investigated the effects of TGCp-tACS on WM in older adults and compared their responses with those of younger participants from our previous work who underwent the same experimental design. Twenty-eight older subjects underwent both TGCp-tACS and sham stimulation sessions at least 72 h apart. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after the interventions, and a WM task battery with five different WM tasks was performed during the interventions to assess various WM components. Outcomes measured included WM task performance (e.g., accuracy, reaction time (RT)) and changes in power spectral density (PSD) in different frequency bands. TGCp-tACS significantly decreased accuracy and RT on the 10- and 14-point Sternberg tasks and increased RT on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in older adults. In contrast, younger participants showed a significant increase in accuracy only on the 14-item Sternberg task. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a decrease in delta and theta PSD and an increase in high gamma PSD in both younger and older participants after verum stimulation. In conclusion, theta-gamma coupling is essential for WM and modulation of this coupling affects WM performance. The effects of TGCp-tACS on WM vary with age due to natural brain changes. To better support older adults, the study suggests several strategies to improve cognitive function, including: Adjusting stimulation parameters, applying stimulation to two sites, conducting multiple sessions, and using brain imaging techniques for precise targeting.","Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), Theta-gamma coupling, Working memory (WM), Electroencephalography (EEG), Power spectral density (PSD)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01149-8,2024

To answer these questions, we performed LPS challenge experiments by intraperitoneal injection in mice and found that Lcn2 levels were significantly increased in the brain, recapitulating in vitro experiments using astrocytes. Co-administration of LPS and BTZ reduced the Lcn2 levels compared to the levels in LPS-treated controls. Upon LPS challenge, the expression levels of glial marker genes were upregulated in the mouse brain. Of note, this upregulation was hampered by the co-administration of BTZ.

Given the limited capacity of WM, researchers have investigated various methods to improve it, including transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which modulates brain activity at specific frequencies. One particularly promising approach is theta-gamma peak-coupled-tACS (TGCp-tACS), which simulates the natural interaction between theta and gamma oscillations that occurs during cognitive control in the brain. The aim of this study was to improve WM in healthy young adults with TGCp-tACS, focusing on both behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. Thirty-one participants completed five WM tasks under both sham and verum stimulation conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings before and after stimulation showed that TGCp-tACS increased power spectral density (PSD) in the high-gamma region at the stimulation site, while PSD decreased in the theta and delta regions throughout the cortex. From a behavioral perspective, although no significant changes were observed in most tasks, there was a significant improvement in accuracy in the 14-item Sternberg task, indicating an improvement in phonological WM. In conclusion, TGCp-tACS has the potential to promote and improve the phonological component of WM.

We used computational techniques and transcriptomic data from four publicly available databases, to examine the circadian expression of cilia-associated genes within six brain areas: brainstem, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, and suprachiasmatic nucleus. Our analysis reveals that a substantial proportion of cilia transcripts exhibit circadian rhythmicity across the examined regions, with notable overrepresentation in the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We also demonstrate region-specific variations in the abundance and timing of circadian cilia genes’ peaks, indicating an adaptation to the distinct physiological roles of each brain region. Additionally, we show that the rhythmic patterns of cilia transcripts are shifted under various physiological and pathological conditions, including modulation of the dopamine system, high-fat diet, and epileptic conditions, indicating the adaptable nature of cilia transcripts’ oscillation. While limited to a few mouse brain regions, our study provides initial insights into the distinct circadian patterns of cilia transcripts and highlights the need for future research to expand the mapping across wider brain areas to fully understand the role of cilia’s spatiotemporal dynamics in brain functions.","Cilia, Mouse, Brain, Nocturnal, Transcriptome, Circadian, Physiology",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01143-0,2024

This channel participates in the migration and adhesion of non-excitable cells and forms an integral part of the focal adhesion complex. In neurons, TRPM4 expression starts before birth and its function at this stage is not clear, but it may function in processes such as neurite development. Here we investigate the role of TRPM4 in neuritogenesis. We found that neurons at DIV 0 express TRPM4, the inhibition of TRPM4 using 9-Ph reduces neurite number and slows the progression of neurite development, keeping neurons in stage 1. The genetic suppression of TRPM4 using an shRNA at later stages (DIV2) reduces neurite length. Conversely, at DIV 0, TRPM4 inhibition augments the Cch-induced Ca2 + i increase, altering the calcium homeostasis. Together, these results show that TRPM4 participates in progression of neurite development and suggest a critical role of the calcium modulation during this stage of neuronal development.","TRPM4, Neuritogenesis, Cortical neuron development, Intracellular calcium",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01140-3,2024

However, the neural mechanism at the molecular level is still unclear. Due to the limitations of research conditions, studies of biological changes in the primate brain have been comparatively few. We took advantage of -6° head-down bed rest (HDBR), one of the most implemented space analogues on the ground, to investigate the effects of simulated weightlessness on non-human primate brain metabolites. The Rhesus Macaque monkeys in the experiment were divided into three groups: the control group, the 42-day simulated weightlessness group with HDBR, and the recovery group, which had 28 days of free activity in the home cage after the HDBR. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to perform metabolomics analysis on specific brain areas of the monkeys under three experimental conditions. Our results show that simulated weightlessness can cause neurotransmitter imbalances, the amino acid and energy metabolism disorders, and hormone disturbances. But these metabolomics changes are reversible after recovery. Our study suggests that long-term brain damage in space flight might be reversible at the metabolic level.

Our research identified ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1) as a key regulator of the engulfment process of efferocytosis after IS by analyzing public datasets and validating findings in a mouse model, revealing its close ties to IS progression. We demonstrated that EA can reduce neuronal cell death and excessive inflammation caused by I/R. Furthermore, EA treatment increased Abca1 expression, prevented microglia activation, promoted M2 microglia polarization, and enhanced their ability to phagocytose injured neurons in I/R mice.

This study explores the relationship between biomarkers like GAP-43, Aβ, tau, and P-tau, and brain connectivity. We enrolled 25 Participants with normal cognitive function and 23 patients with MCI. Levels of GAP-43, Aβ1–42, t-tau, and p-tau181p in the CSF were measured, and functional connectivity measures including ROI-to-voxel (RV) correlations and the DMN RV-ratio were extracted from the resting-state fMRI data. P-values below 0.05 were considered significant. The results showed that in CN individuals, higher connectivity within the both anterior default mode network (aDMN) and posterior DMN (pDMN) was associated with higher levels of the biomarker GAP-43. In contrast, MCI individuals showed significant negative correlations between DMN connectivity and levels of tau and P-tau. Notably, no significant correlations were found between Aβ levels and connectivity measures in either group. These findings suggest that elevated levels of GAP-43 indicate increased functional connectivity in aDMN and pDMN. Conversely, elevated levels of tau and p-tau can disrupt connectivity through various mechanisms.

Chronic restraint stress induced both depressive and submissive behaviors. Chemogenetic mPFC astrocyte activation significantly enhanced dominance in chronic stress-induced submissive mice by increasing the persistence of defensive behavior, although it did not affect depressive behaviors. Notably, repetitive winning experiences following mPFC astrocyte stimulation exerted anti-depressive effects in chronic restraint stress-induced depressive mice.

Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of UBL3 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was 6- to 7-fold higher than that in the cerebellum. Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitation of protein extracts from the cerebral cortex of Ubl3+/+ and Ubl3Tg/+ mice using avidin beads to comprehensively discover UBL3 interacting proteins, identifying 35 new UBL3 interacting proteins. Nine proteins were annotated as extracellular exosomes. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggested a new relationship between sEVs and RNA metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases.

Using a rat model of hind limb thrombus-induced ischemic pain (TIIP), we observed an increase in P450scc expression in the ischemic hind paw skin. Inhibiting P450scc with intraplantar aminoglutethimide (AMG) administration from post-operative day 0 to 3 significantly reduced the development of mechanical allodynia. However, AMG administration from post-operative day 3 to 6 did not affect established mechanical allodynia. In addition, we explored the role of the peripheral sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) by co-administering PRE-084 (PRE), a Sig-1R agonist, with AMG. PRE reversed the analgesic effects of AMG during the induction phase. These findings indicate that inhibiting steroidogenesis with AMG alleviates peripheral ischemic pain during the induction phase via Sig-1Rs.","Ischemic pain, Neuroactive steroid, Aminoglutethimide, Cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage, Sigma-1 receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01125-2,2024

We found that Nrxn3 expression in the PVN was upregulated in response to metabolic stressors, including cold exposure and fasting. Using Cre-loxP technology, we selectively ablated Nrxn3 in CaMKIIα-expressing neurons of the PVN in male mice. This genetic manipulation resulted in marked weight gain attributable to increased adiposity and impaired glucose tolerance, without affecting food intake. Our findings identify PVN CaMKIIα-expressing neurons as a critical locus where Nrxn3 modulates energy balance by regulating adipogenesis and glucose metabolism, independently of appetite.

An analysis of magnetic resonance images showed that LPS-ip reduced the initial brain injury but slowed injury repair. An immunostaining analysis using the neuronal marker, NeuN, showed that LPS-ip delayed removal of dead/dying neurons, despite the fact that LPS-ip enhanced infiltration of monocytes, which serve to phagocytize dead cells/debris. Notably, infiltrating monocytes showed a widely scattered distribution. Bulk RNAseq analyses showed that LPS-ip decreased expression of genes associated with phagocytosis, with PCR and immunostaining of injured brains confirming reduced levels of Cd68 and Clec7a, markers of phagocytic activity, in monocytes.

Injection of the retrotracer Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB-488) into the LC allowed the identification of LC-projecting neurons in the vlPAG. Electrophysiological recordings from CTB-488 positive cells revealed that both GABAergic and glutamatergic cells that project to the LC exhibited reduced intrinsic excitability after peripheral nerve injury. By contrast, CTB-488 negative cells did not exhibit alterations in firing properties after SNI surgery. An SNI-induced reduction of LC projecting cells was confirmed with c-fos labeling.

We utilized data from a normative MWF brain atlas, comprised of 50 healthy subjects (mean age = 25 years, range = 17–42 years) scanned at 3 Tesla. Magnetic resonance imaging data included myelin water imaging to extract MWF and T1 anatomical scans for image registration and segmentation. We investigated the inter-regional distributions of gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas in conjunction with inter-regional MWF distribution patterns. Pearson correlations were used to identify genes with expression profiles mirroring MWF. The Single Cell Type Atlas from the Human Protein Atlas was leveraged to classify genes into gene sets with high cell type specificity, and a control gene set with low cell type specificity. Then, we compared the Pearson correlation coefficients for each gene set to determine if cell type-specific gene expression signatures correlate with MWF. Pearson correlation coefficients between MWF and gene expression for oligodendrocytes and adipocytes were significantly higher than for the control gene set, whereas correlations between MWF and inhibitory/excitatory neurons were significantly lower.

A key characteristic of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, which play pivotal roles in disease progression. These plaques initiate a cascade of events including neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, tau pathology, oxidative stress, impaired protein clearance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disrupted calcium homeostasis. Aβ accumulation is also closely associated with other hallmark features of AD, underscoring its significance. Aβ is generated through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and plays a dual role depending on its processing pathway. The non-amyloidogenic pathway reduces Aβ production and has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas the amyloidogenic pathway leads to the production of Aβ peptides, including Aβ40 and Aβ42, which contribute to neurodegeneration and toxic effects in AD. Understanding the multifaceted role of Aβ, particularly in AD, is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies that target Aβ metabolism, aggregation, and clearance with the aim of mitigating the detrimental consequences of the disease.

Histamine in the central nervous system is a promising target for facilitating the recovery of memory retrieval. Our previous study demonstrated that histamine H3 receptor (H3R) inverse agonists/antagonists, activating histamine synthesis and release, enhance activity in the perirhinal cortex and help in retrieving forgotten long-term object recognition memories. However, it is unclear whether enhancing histaminergic activity alone is enough for the recovery of memory retrieval, considering that H3Rs are also located in other neuron types and affect the release of multiple neurotransmitters. In this study, we employed a chemogenetic method to determine whether specifically activating histamine neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus facilitates memory retrieval. In the novel object recognition test, control mice did not show a preference for objects based on memory 1 week after training, but chemogenetic activation of histamine neurons before testing improved memory retrieval. This selective activation did not affect the locomotor activity or anxiety-related behavior. Administering an H2R antagonist directly into the perirhinal cortex inhibited the recovery of memory retrieval induced by the activation of histamine neurons. Furthermore, we utilized the Barnes maze test to investigate whether chemogenetic activation of histamine neurons influences the retrieval of forgotten spatial memories. Control mice explored all the holes in the maze equally 1 week after training, whereas mice with chemogenetically activated histamine neurons spent more time around the target hole. These findings indicate that chemogenetic activation of histamine neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus can promote retrieval of seemingly forgotten object recognition and spatial memories.","Histamine, Tuberomammillary nucleus, Memory, Retrieval, Chemogenetics, Perirhinal cortex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01111-8,2024

It is unclear, however, whether altering DA neuronal activity via chemogenetics early in development leads to behavioral phenotypes that are reversible, as alterations of neuronal activity during developmentally sensitive periods might be expected to induce persistent effects on behavior. To examine the impact of developmental perturbation of DA neuron activity on basal and AMPH behavior, we expressed excitatory hM3D(Gq) in postnatal DA neurons in TH-Cre and WT mice. Basal and CNO- or AMPH-induced locomotion and stereotypy was evaluated in a longitudinal design, with clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 1.0 mg/kg) administered across adolescence (postnatal days 15–47).

Most of the studies of synaptic plasticity have been carried out by induction via electrophysiological stimulation. It is largely unknown in which behavioural tasks such synaptic plasticity occurs. Moreover, some stimuli can induce both LTP and LTD, thus making it difficult to separately study the different forms of synaptic plasticity. Two studies have shown that an aversive memory task – inhibitory avoidance learning and contextual fear conditioning – physiologically and selectively induce LTP and an LTP-like molecular change, respectively, in the hippocampus in vivo.

This analogy further elucidates how the depletion of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease can result in bradykinesia. However, the question arises: are these direct and indirect pathways truly autonomous? Despite being distinct types of neurons, their interdependence cannot be overlooked. Single-neuron tracing studies employing membrane-targeting signals have shown that the majority of direct pathway neurons terminate not only in the output nuclei, but also in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GP in rodents), a relay nucleus of the indirect pathway. Recent studies have unveiled the existence of arkypallidal neurons, which project solely to the striatum, in addition to prototypic neurons. This raises the question of which type of GP neurons receive these striatal axon collaterals. Our morphological and electrophysiological experiments showed that the striatal direct pathway neurons may affect prototypic neurons via the action of substance P on neurokinin-1 receptors. Conversely, another research group has reported that direct pathway neurons inhibit arkypallidal neurons via GABA.

These mutations typically result in haploinsufficiency of the progranulin protein. Grn+/– mice provide a model for progranulin haploinsufficiency and develop FTD-like behavioral abnormalities by 9–10 months of age. In previous work, we demonstrated that Grn+/– mice develop a low dominance phenotype in the tube test that is associated with reduced dendritic arborization of layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region key for social dominance behavior in the tube test assay. In this study, we investigated whether progranulin haploinsufficiency induced changes in dendritic spine density and morphology. Individual layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic mPFC of 9–10 month old wild-type or Grn+/– mice were targeted for iontophoretic microinjection of fluorescent dye, followed by high-resolution confocal microscopy and 3D reconstruction for morphometry analysis. Dendritic spine density in Grn+/– mice was comparable to wild-type littermates, but the apical dendrites in Grn+/– mice had a shift in the proportion of spine types, with fewer stubby spines and more thin spines. Additionally, apical dendrites of Grn+/– mice had longer spines and smaller thin spine head diameter in comparison to wild-type littermates. These changes in spine morphology may contribute to altered circuit-level activity and social dominance deficits in Grn+/– mice.","Progranulin, Frontotemporal Dementia, Dendritic spines, Social dominance, Prefrontal cortex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01095-5,2024

One aspect of the neuropathology involved in ALS includes increased genomic damage and impaired DNA repair capability. The TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP43) has been associated with both sporadic and familial forms of ALS, and is typically observed as cytosolic mislocalization of protein aggregates, termed TDP43 proteinopathy. TDP43 is a ubiquitous RNA/DNA binding protein with functional implications in a wide range of disease processes, including the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). While TDP43 is widely known to regulate RNA metabolism, our lab has reported it also functions directly at the protein level to facilitate DNA repair. Here, we show that the TDP43 protein interacts with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1 and MSH6 in a DNA damage-inducible manner. We utilized differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cultures to identify this inducible relationship using complementary approaches of proximity ligation assay (PLA) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assay. We observed that signals of TDP43 interaction with MLH1 and MSH6 increased significantly following a 2 h treatment of 10 μM methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), a DNA alkylating agent used to induce MMR repair. Likewise, we observed this effect was abolished in cell lines treated with siRNA directed against TDP43. Finally, we demonstrated these protein interactions were significantly increased in lumbar spinal cord samples of ALS-affected patients compared to age-matched controls. These results will inform our future studies to understand the mechanisms and consequences of this TDP43-MMR interaction in the context of ALS-affected neurons.","TDP-43, DNA mismatch repair (MMR), DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), Neurodegeneration, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP), Proximity ligation assay (PLA)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01108-3,2024

The underlying mechanisms of fibromyalgia involve both the immune system and the central nervous system. It has been proposed that changes in multiple ascending and descending pathways in the central nervous system may contribute to increased pain sensitivity in individuals with this condition. Recent research has identified S100 proteins as a new area of interest in fibromyalgia studies. These proteins are a group of small molecular weight proteins involved in inflammation and various functions inside and outside of cells, and they may play a critical role in the development and progression of FM. Although S100B has been the most studied in FM patients, other studies have reported that S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 may also be useful as potential biomarkers or for a deeper understanding of FM pathophysiology. The potential role of S100 proteins in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia could be mediated by RAGE and TLR4, which signal through JNK, ERK, and p38 to activate AP-1 and NF-κB and induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby producing the inflammation, fatigue, and chronic pain characteristic of fibromyalgia. To gain new perspectives on targeted therapeutic approaches, it is crucial to understand how S100 proteins could impact the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia.

However, detailed spatial and temporal analysis of oligodendroglial αsyn aggregates was technically difficult due to the background neuronal αsyn aggregates. The aim of this study is to create a novel mouse that easily enables sensitive and specific detection of αsyn aggregates in OLGs and the comparable analysis of the cellular tropism of αsyn aggregates in MSA brains. To this end, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human αsyn-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in OLGs under the control of the 2’, 3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase (CNP) promoter (CNP-SNCAGFP Tg mice). Injection of αsyn PFFs in these mice induced distinct GFP-positive aggregates in the processes of OLGs as early as one month post-inoculation (mpi), and their number and size increased in a centripetal manner. Moreover, MSA-brain homogenates (BH) induced significantly more oligodendroglial αsyn aggregates than neuronal αsyn aggregates compared to DLB-BH in CNP-SNCAGFP Tg mice, suggestive of their potential tropism of αsyn seeds for OLGs. In conclusion, CNP-SNCAGFP Tg mice are useful for studying the development and tropism of αsyn aggregates in OLGs and could contribute to the development of therapeutics targeting αsyn aggregates in OLGs.","Multiple system atrophy, MSA, α-synuclein, Glial cytoplasmic inclusions, GCI, Mouse model, Cellular tropism, Propagation, Prion hypothesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01104-7,2024

Itch itself elicits an unpleasant experience, which triggers the urge to scratch, relieving the itchiness. Still, it can also result in dissatisfaction when the scratch is too intense and painful or unsatisfactory due to insufficient scratch effect. Therefore, it is likely that the balance between the unpleasantness/pleasure and satisfaction/unsatisfaction associated with itch sensation and scratching behavior is determined by complex brain mechanisms. The physiological/pathological mechanisms underlying this balance remain largely elusive. To address this issue, we targeted the ""reward center"" of the brain, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), in which itch-responsive neurons have been found in rodents. We examined how neurons in the NAc are activated or suppressed during histamine-induced scratching behaviors in mice. The mice received an intradermal injection of histamine or saline at the neck, and the scratching number was analyzed by recording the movement of the bilateral hind limbs for about 45 min after injection. To experimentally manipulate the scratch efficacy in these histamine models, we compared histamine's behavioral and neuronal effects between mice with intact and clipped nails on the hind paws. As expected, the clipping of the hind limb nail increased the number of scratches after the histamine injection. In the brains of mice exhibiting scratching behaviors, we analyzed the expression of the c-fos gene (Fos) as a readout of an immediate activation of neurons during itch/scratch and dopamine receptors (Drd1 and Drd2) using multiplex single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNAscope) in the NAc and surrounding structures. We performed a model-free analysis of gene expression in geometrically divided NAc subregions without assuming the conventional core–shell divisions. The results indicated that even within the NAc, multiple subregions responded differentially to various itch/scratch conditions. We also found different clusters with neurons showing similar or opposite changes in Fos expression and the correlation between scratch number and Fos expression in different itch/scratch conditions. These regional differences and clusters would provide a basis for the complex role of the NAc and surrounding structures in encoding the outcomes of scratching behavior and itchy sensations.","Hierarchical cluster analysis, Dopamine receptors, Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNAscope, Histamine, Nail clipping, c-fos",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01101-w,2024

Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, isolated spinal ACSA-2+ cells were divided into two distinct populations, ACSA-2high and ACSA-2low. By analyzing the expression of cell-type marker genes, the ACSA-2high and ACSA-2low populations were identified as astrocytes and ependymal cells, respectively. Furthermore, ACSA-2high cells had mRNAs encoding genes that were abundantly expressed in the gray matter (GM) but not white matter astrocytes. By optimizing enzymatic isolation procedures, the yield of GM astrocytes also increased. Therefore, our newly established method enabled the selective and efficient isolation of GM astrocytes from the spinal cord of adult mice and may be useful for bulk- or single-cell RNA-sequencing under physiological and pathological conditions.","Astrocytes, Spinal cord, ACSA-2 antibody, Cold-active protease, Gray matter, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, DRAQ5",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01097-3,2024

Here, we investigated the proportion of CD11c+ microglia in six CNS regions (forebrain, olfactory bulb, diencephalon/midbrain, cerebellum, pons/medulla, and spinal cord) from the developmental to adult stages by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses using a CD11c reporter transgenic mouse line, Itgax-Venus. We found that the proportion of CD11c+ microglia in total microglia varied between CNS regions during postnatal development. Specifically, the proportion was high in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum at postnatal day P(4) and P7, respectively, and approximately half of the total microglia were CD11c+. The proportion declined sharply in all regions to P14, and the low percentage persisted over P56. In the spinal cord, the proportion of CD11c+ microglia was also high at P4 and declined to P14, but increased again at P21 and thereafter. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of CD11c+ microglia in the spinal cord markedly changed from gray matter at P4 to white matter at P21.

In the present study, we evaluated possible changes in excessive secretion of gut microbiota-derived endotoxin and the expression timeline of several inflammation-regulatory mediators and their inhibiting modulators in hypothalamic microglia of a mouse model of cancer cachexia following transplantation of pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrated that the plasma level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly increased with an increase in anaerobic bacteria, especially Firmicutes, in the gut at the late stage of tumor-bearing mice that exhibited dramatic appetite loss, sarcopenia and severe peripheral immune suppression. At the early stage, in which tumor-bearing mice had not yet displayed “cachexia symptoms”, the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not of the neurodegenerative and severe inflammatory modulator lipocalin-2 (LCN2), was significantly increased, whereas at the late “cachexia stage”, the level of LCN2 mRNA was significantly increased along with significant decreases in levels of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and CD112R in hypothalamic microglia. In addition, a high density of activated neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus region and a significant increase in corticosterone secretion were found in cachexia model mice. Related to the cachexia state, released corticosterone was clearly increased in normal mice with specific activation of PVN neurons. A marked decrease in the natural killer cell population was also observed in the spleen of mice with robust activation of PVN neurons as well as mice with cancer cachexia. On the other hand, in vivo administration of LPS in normal mice induced hypothalamic microglia with low expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors.

Central to this strategy is the use of single-cell technologies that allow detection of molecular changes in cells at the time of phenotypical bifurcation from health to disease. In this article we describe a general procedure to support such an approach applied to neurodegenerative disorders. This procedure combines four components directed towards highly complementary objectives: 1) a high-performance single-cell proteomics (SCP) method (Detect), 2) the development of disease experimental cell models and predictive computational models of cell trajectories (Understand), 3) the discovery of specific targets and personalized therapies (Cure), and 4) the creation of a community of collaborating laboratories to accelerate the development of this novel medical paradigm (Collaborate). A global initiative named 37TrillionCells (37TC) was launched to advance the development of cell-based interception and precision medicine.","37TrillionCells, Single-cell proteomics, SCoPE2-MS, Cell-based interception and precision medicine, iPSC, Organoid, Leukodystrophy, POLR3-HLD",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01088-4,2024

While being required for long-term depression (LTD) mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR-LTD), little is known about its role in other forms of LTD induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS-LTD) or spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Using electrophysiology in ex vivo hippocampal slices from SP-deficient mice (SPKO), we show that absence of SP is associated with a deficit of LTD at Sc-CA1 synapses induced by LFS-LTD and STDP. As LTD is known to require AMPA- receptors internalization and IP3-receptors calcium signaling, we tested by western blotting and immunochemistry if there were changes in their expression which we found to be reduced. While we were not able to induce LTD, long-term potentiation (LTP), albeit diminished in SPKO, can be recovered by using a stronger stimulation protocol. In SPKO we found no differences in NMDAR, which are the primary site of calcium signalling to induce LTP. Our study shows, for the first time, the key role of the requirement of SP to allow induction of activity-dependant LTD at Sc-CA1 synapses.","Synaptopodin, Synaptic plasticity, hippocampus, STDP, LTD, IP3",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01089-3,2024

In this study, we utilized Nlgn3 mutant mice selectively lacking the interaction with either NRXNs or PTPδ and investigated their social and memory performance. Neither Nlgn3 mutants showed any social cognitive deficiency in the social novelty recognition test. However, the Nlgn3 mutant mice lacking the PTPδ pathway exhibited significant decline in the social conditioned place preference (sCPP) at the juvenile stage, suggesting the involvement of the NLGN3-PTPδ pathway in the regulation of social motivation and reward. In terms of learning and memory, disrupting the canonical NRXN pathway attenuated contextual fear conditioning while disrupting the noncanonical NLGN3-PTPδ pathway enhanced it. Furthermore, disruption of the NLGN3-PTPδ pathway negatively affected the remote spatial reference memory in the Barnes maze test.

It is caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of a long CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence within the ATXN3 gene, encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat sequence within the ataxin-3 protein. Ataxin-3 containing an expanded polyQ repeat is known to be highly prone to intraneuronal aggregation, and previous studies have demonstrated that protein quality control pathways, such as autophagy, are impaired in MJD patients and animal models of the disease. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of spermidine on zebrafish and rodent models of MJD to determine its capacity to induce autophagy and improve functional output. Spermidine treatment of transgenic MJD zebrafish induced autophagy and resulted in increased distances swum by the MJD zebrafish. Interestingly, treatment of the CMVMJD135 mouse model of MJD with spermidine added to drinking water did not produce any improvement in motor behaviour assays, neurological testing or neuropathology. In fact, wild type mice treated with spermidine were found to have decreased rotarod performance when compared to control animals. Immunoblot analysis of protein lysates extracted from mouse cerebellar tissue found little differences between the groups, except for an increased level of phospho-ULK1 in spermidine treated animals, suggesting that autophagy was indeed induced. As we detected decreased motor performance in wild type mice following treatment with spermidine, we conducted follow up studies into the effects of spermidine treatment in zebrafish. Interestingly, we found that in addition to inducing autophagy, spermidine treatment also induced apoptosis, particularly in wild type zebrafish. These findings suggest that spermidine treatment may not be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of MJD, and in fact warrants caution due to the potential negative side effects caused by induction of apoptosis.","Machado-Joseph disease, Neurodegeneration, PolyQ, Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, Autophagy, Zebrafish, Trinucleotide repeat disease",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01085-7,2024

This study aim to explore the potential mechanism of TREM2 in regulating microglia function in ASD.Materials and methodsThe offspring rat model of ASD was established through prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), and the behavioral symptoms of the ASD model were observed. On postnatal day (PND) 7 and PND 28, the effects of prenatally exposure to VPA on synaptic development and microglia phenotype of offspring rats were observed. Primary microglia were cultured in vitro. Lentivirus and adenovirus were utilized to interfere with TREM2 and overexpress TREM2.ResultsPrenatally VPA exposure induced offspring rats to show typical ASD core symptoms, which led to abnormal expression of synapse-related proteins in the prefrontal cortex of offspring rats, changed the phenotype of microglia in offspring rats, promoted the polarization of microglia to pro-inflammatory type, and increased inflammatory response. The experimental results in vitro showed that overexpression of TREM2 could increase the expression of Gephyrin, decrease the content of CD86 protein and increase the content of CD206 protein. In addition, after the expression of TREM2 was interfered, the content of p-P38 MAPK protein increased and the content of p-ELK-1 protein decreased.ConclusionThe protective influence of TREM2 on the VPA-induced ASD model is attributed to its inhibition of the P38 MAPK pathway, this protective effect may be achieved by promoting the polarization of microglia to anti-inflammatory phenotype and improving the neuronal synaptic development.","Autism spectrum disorder, Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2, Microglial cells, Synaptic, Valproic acid, P38 MAPK pathway",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01081-x,2024

Defining what constitutes the claustrum is imperative for elucidating its functions. Methods based on gene/protein expression or transgenic mice have been used to spatially outline the claustrum but often report incomplete labeling and/or lack of specificity during certain neurodevelopmental timepoints. To reliably identify claustrum projection cells in mice, we propose a simple immunolabelling method that juxtaposes the expression pattern of claustrum-enriched and cortical-enriched markers. We determined that claustrum cells immunoreactive for the claustrum-enriched markers Nurr1 and Nr2f2 are devoid of the cortical marker Tle4, which allowed us to differentiate the claustrum from adjoining cortical cells. Using retrograde tracing, we verified that nearly all claustrum projection neurons lack Tle4 but expressed Nurr1/Nr2f2 markers to different degrees. At neonatal stages between 7 and 21 days, claustrum projection neurons were identified by their Nurr1-postive/Tle4-negative expression profile, a time-period when other immunolabelling techniques used to localize the claustrum in adult mice are ineffective. Finally, exposure to environmental novelty enhanced the expression of the neuronal activation marker c-Fos in the claustrum region. Notably, c-Fos labeling was mainly restricted to Nurr1-positive cells and nearly absent from Tle4-positive cells, thus corroborating previous work reporting novelty-induced claustrum activation. Taken together, this method will aid in studying the claustrum during postnatal development and may improve histological and functional studies where other approaches are not amenable.","Claustrum, Clautrocortical, Anterior cingulate cortex, Retrosplenial cortex, Nurr1, Nr2f2, Tle4, c-Fos, Open field",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01082-w,2024

However, little is known about how Tau’s phosphorylation state affects its dynamics and organisation at the single-molecule level. Here, using quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy, we examined how mimicking or abrogating phosphorylation at 14 disease-associated serine and threonine residues through mutagenesis influences the behaviour of Tau in live Neuro-2a cells.

Notably, we found that the mobility of TauE14 molecules was higher than wild-type Tau molecules, while TauA14 molecules displayed lower mobility. Moreover, TauA14 was organised in a filament-like structure resembling cytoskeletal filaments, within which TauA14 exhibited spatial and kinetic heterogeneity. Our study provides a direct visualisation of how the phosphorylation state of Tau affects its spatial and temporal organisation, presumably reflecting the phosphorylation-dependent changes in the interactions between Tau and its partners.

Recently, it was found that enzyme Ornithine Decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) acts as a bridge between the astrocytic urea cycle and the putrescine-to-GABA conversion pathway in the brain of AD mouse models as well as human patients. In this study, we show that the long-term knockdown of astrocytic Odc1 in APP/PS1 animals was sufficient to completely clear Aβ plaques in the hippocampus while simultaneously switching the astrocytes from a detrimental reactive state to a regenerative active state, characterized by proBDNF expression. Our experiments also reveal an effect of astrocytic ODC1 inhibition on the expression of genes involved in synapse pruning and organization, histone modification, apoptotic signaling and protein processing. These genes are previously known to be associated with astrocytic activation and together create a neuroregeneration-supportive environment in the brain. By inhibiting ODC1 for a long period of 3 months in AD mice, we demonstrate that the beneficial amyloid-clearing process of astrocytes can be completely segregated from the systemically harmful astrocytic response to insult. Our study reports an almost complete clearance of Aβ plaques by controlling an endogenous degradation process, which also modifies the astrocytic state to create a regeneration-supportive environment in the brain.

While recent studies have begun to reveal the mechanisms that specify the generation of cone subtypes during development in mammals, nothing is known about how the mosaic of mutually exclusive cone subtypes is maintained in the mammalian retina. In Drosophila, recent work has led to the identification of several intrinsic factors that maintain the identity of R8 photoreceptor subtypes in adults. Whether and how extrinsic mechanisms are involved, however, remain unknown. In this study, we present evidence that supports that the Drosophila transsynaptic adhesion molecule Neurexin 1 (Dnrx-1) is required non-cell autonomously in R8p subtypes for the maintenance of R8y subtype identity. Silencing the activity of R8p subtypes caused a phenotype identical to that in dnrx-1 mutants.

We investigate the three-dimensional expression patterns of Piezo1, Piezo2, and TMEM150C, while also examining their associated histological features and mechanotransduction signaling networks, particularly focusing on the YAP/β-catenin axis. Our results showed that the biomechanical characteristics (including stiffness, spring term, and equilibrium stress) associated with Piezo1 vary depending on the specific region. Moving beyond Piezo1, our result demonstrated the significant positive correlations between Piezo2 expression and stiffness in the WM. Meanwhile, the expression of Piezo2 and TMEM150C was shown to be correlated to viscoelastic properties in the pons and WM. Given the heterogeneity of brain tissue, we investigated the three-dimensional expression of Piezo1, Piezo2, and TMEM150C.

Although the etiology of ALS remains poorly understood in most cases, the remodelling of ion channels and alteration in neuronal excitability represent a hallmark of the disease, manifesting not only during the symptomatic period but also in the early pre-symptomatic stages.

The perisynaptic astrocytic process (PAP) is the key structure that allows astrocytes to play these roles and not only physically supports synapse formation through cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) but also regulates the efficiency of chemical signaling. Accumulating evidence has revealed that spinal astrocytes are involved in pathological pain by modulating the efficacy of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA through transporters located in the PAP and by directly regulating synaptic transmission through various gliotransmitters. Although various CAMs contribute to pathological pain, insufficient evidence is available as to whether astrocytic CAMs also have this role.

In the present study, we analyzed sequencing data from female hippocampus and normal breast aspirate samples from normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) women, and the results suggest that abnormal ERs signaling is associated with dyslipidemia and cognitive dysfunction. We replicated a mouse model of dyslipidemia and postmenopausal status in LDLR−/− mice and treated them with β-estradiol or simvastatin, and found that ovariectomy in LDLR−/− mice led to an exacerbation of dyslipidemia and increased hippocampal apoptosis and cognitive impairment, which were associated with reduced estradiol levels and ERα, ERβ and GPER expression. In vitro, a lipid overload model of SH-SY-5Y cells was established and treated with inhibitors of ERs. β-estradiol or simvastatin effectively attenuated dyslipidemia-induced neuronal apoptosis via upregulation of ERs, whereas ERα, ERβ and GPER inhibitors together abolished the protective effect of simvastatin on lipid-induced neuronal apoptosis. We conclude that decreased estrogen and its receptor function in the postmenopausal stage promote neuronal damage and cognitive impairment by exacerbating dyslipidemia, and that estrogen supplementation or lipid lowering is an effective way to ameliorate hippocampal damage and cognitive dysfunction via upregulation of ERs.Graphical Abstract","Menopause, Dyslipidemia, Cognition impairment, Estradiol, Estrogen receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01068-0,2023

Pregabalin, used clinically in the treatment of chronic pain and epilepsy, inhibits P/Q-type calcium channel activity and recent studies suggest that it may have potential for the treatment of migraine. Spreading Depolarization (SD) is a neurophysiological phenomenon that can occur during migraine with aura by propagating a wave of silenced neuronal function through cortex and sometimes subcortical brain structures. Here, utilizing an optogenetic stimulation technique optimized to allow for non-invasive initiation of cortical SD, we demonstrate that chronic pregabalin administration [12 mg/kg/day (s.c.)] in vivo increased the threshold for cortical spreading depolarization in transgenic mice harboring the clinically-relevant Cav2.1S218L mutation (S218L). In addition, chronic pregabalin treatment limited subcortical propagation of recurrent spreading depolarization events to the striatum and hippocampus in both wild-type and S218L mice. To examine contributing underlying mechanisms of action of chronic pregabalin, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in CA1 neurons in ex vivo brain slices from mice treated with chronic pregabalin vs vehicle. In WT mice, chronic pregabalin produced a decrease in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) amplitude with no effect on frequency. In contrast, in S218L mice chronic pregabalin produced an increase in sEPSC amplitude and decreased frequency. These electrophysiological findings suggest that in FHM-1 mice chronic pregabalin acts through both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms in CA1 hippocampal neurons to elicit FHM-1 genotype-specific inhibitory action. The results highlight the potential of chronic pregabalin to limit recurrent SD to subcortical brain structures during pathophysiological events in both the genetically-normal and FHM-1 brain. The work further provides insights into FHM-1 pathophysiology and the potential for chronic pregabalin treatment to prevent SD in migraineurs.","Spreading depolarization, Pregabalin, Familial hemiplegic migraine, Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01062-6,2023

The expression of MLKL, connexin 43 (Cx43) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in vitro and in vivo were assessed by Western blot. Bioinformatic methods were used to predict the potential binding sites where MLKL interacted with Cx43, and the ubiquitination degradation of Cx43 regulated by VHL.

Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured using Fluo-4 AM. Overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis studies were used to study the mechanisms by which MLKL regulates Cx43 ubiquitinational degradation to mediate neuronal necroptosis.

Interaction of MLKL Ser454 with Cx43 can trigger the opening of Cx43 hemichannels, causing increased intracellular Ca2+, and cell necroptosis. This innovative study at animal models, cellular, and molecular levels is anticipated to clarify the roles of MLKL and Cx43 in thalamic damage after focal cortical infarction.

Upon expression by AAVs, these monSTIM1 variants significantly increased the expression levels of cFos in neurons and astrocytes in the hippocampal CA1 region following non-invasive light illumination.

However, the mechanism of inflammatory pain is far from clear yet. Rab11a, a small molecule guanosine triphosphate enzyme, is reported to regulate orofacial inflammatory pain in our previous works. However, the mechanism of Rab11a’s involvement in the regulation of inflammatory pain remains obscure. Here, we aim to elucidate the potential mechanisms through which Rab11a contributes to the development of inflammatory pain in the spinal level. It’s shown that neurons, rather than glial cells, were the primary cell type expressing Rab11a in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). After intra-plantar injection of CFA, both the number of Fos/Rab11a-immunopositive neurons and the expression of Rab11a were increased. Administration of Rab11a-shRNA into the SDH resulted in significantly analgesic effect in mice with CFA injection. Application of Rab11a-shRNA also reduced the NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) and the spike number of neurons in lamina II of the SDH in mice with CFA injection, without affecting the presynaptic glutamate release and the postsynaptic AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC. Our results thus suggest that the enhanced expression of neuronal Rab11a may be important for the process of inflammatory pain in mice with CFA injection, which is likely mediated by Rab11a’s potentiation of the competence of post-synaptic NMDAR and spiking of SDH neurons.","Rab11a, Spinal dorsal horn, Inflammatory pain, NMDA receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01057-3,2023

It is associated with the expression of activity-dependent genes that may mediate initial or cellular memory consolidation. Several genes have been identified to date, however, to fully understand the mechanisms of memory consolidation, additional candidates must be identified. In this cross-species study, we used a contextual novelty-exploration paradigm to identify changes in gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus of both mice and rats. We found that changes in gene expression following contextual novelty varied between the two species, with 9 genes being upregulated in mice and 3 genes in rats. Comparison across species revealed that ArfGAP with a GTPase domain, an ankyrin repeat and PH domain 3 (Agap3) was the only gene being upregulated in both, suggesting a potentially conserved role for Agap3. AGAP3 is known to regulate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor trafficking in the synapse, which suggests that increased transcription of Agap3 may be involved in maintaining functional plasticity. While we identified several genes affected by contextual novelty exploration, we were unable to fully reverse these changes using SCH 23390, a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist. Further research on the role of AGAP3 in novelty-induced memory consolidation could lead to better understanding of this process and guide future research.","AGAP3, Novelty, Memory consolidation, Hippocampus, Dopamine, Dopamine receptor antagonist, Locus coeruleus, Immediate-early gene, Behavioural tagging, Synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01056-4,2023

Here, we compared the progression of HD phenotypes in male and female heterozygous FDNQ175 mice. We found that both male and female heterozygous mice showed deficits in forelimb grip strength and cognition as early as 6 months of age. However, female FDNQ175 mice were less vulnerable to HD-associated decline in limb coordination and movement. Neither male nor female FDNQ175 mice exhibited reduced locomotor activity in the open field or exhibit consistent differences in anxiety at 6–12 months of age. Both male and female FDNQ175 mice exhibited increased numbers of huntingtin aggregates with age and 8-month-old female FDNQ175 mice had significantly more aggregates than their male counterparts.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that Purkinje cells (PCs), which have established adult-type monosynaptic innervation by climbing fibers (CFs) after elimination of weak CFs during development, can be reinnervated by multiple CFs by increased expression of the synaptic organizer C1ql1 in CFs or Bai3, a receptor for C1ql1, in PCs. In the adult cerebellum, CFs are known to have transverse branches that run in a mediolateral direction without forming synapses with PCs. Electrophysiological, Ca2+-imaging and immunohistochemical studies showed that overexpression of C1ql1 or Bai3 caused these CF transverse branches to elongate and synapse on the distal dendrites of mature PCs. Mature PCs were also reinnervated by multiple CFs when the glutamate receptor GluD2, which is essential for the maintenance of synapses between granule cells and PCs, was deleted. Interestingly, the effect of GluD2 knockout was not observed in Bai3 knockout PCs. In addition, C1ql1 levels were significantly upregulated in CFs of GluD2 knockout mice, suggesting that endogenous, not overexpressed, C1ql1-Bai3 signaling could regulate the reinnervation of mature PCs by CFs. Furthermore, the effects of C1ql1 and Bai3 overexpression required neuronal activity in the PC and CF, respectively. C1ql1 immunoreactivity at CF-PC synapses was reduced when the neuronal activity of CFs was suppressed. These results suggest that C1ql1-Bai3 signaling may mediate CF synaptogenesis in mature PCs, potentially in concert with neuronal activity.","Cerebellum, Purkinje cell, Climbing fiber, Synapse, Electrophysiology, C1ql1, Bai3",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01048-4,2023

Recent studies on schizophrenia have highlighted the involvement of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms with the onset of symptoms, and the usage of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested against periods of rapid psychosis. In the central nervous system, microglia are the innate immune population which are activated in response to a wide range of physical and psychological stress factors and produce proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines.

This study aims to determine the cellular origin of TSPO overexpression in a simplified model of neuroinflammation and to identify the molecular pathways involved. This is essential to better interpret TSPO molecular imaging in preclinical and clinical settings. We used lentiviral vectors (LV) to overexpress the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in the right striatum of 2-month-old Sprague Dawley rats. A LV encoding for β-Galactosidase (LV-LacZ) was used as control. One month later, TSPO expression was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using [125I]CLINDE. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting to radioligand-treated tissue (FACS-RTT) method was used to quantify TSPO levels in acutely sorted astrocytes, microglia, neurons and endothelial cells. A second cohort was injected with LV-CNTF and a LV encoding suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), to inhibit the JAK-STAT3 pathway specifically in astrocytes. GFAP and TSPO expressions were quantified by immunofluorescence. We measured a significant increase in TSPO signal in response to CNTF by SPECT imaging. Using FACS-RTT, we observed TSPO overexpression in reactive astrocytes (+ 153 ± 62%) but also in microglia (+ 2088 ± 500%) and neurons (+ 369 ± 117%), accompanied by an increase in TSPO binding sites per cell in those three cell populations. Endothelial cells did not contribute to TSPO signal increase. Importantly, LV-SOCS3 reduced CNTF-induced astrocyte reactivity and decreased global TSPO immunoreactivity (-71% ± 30%), suggesting that TSPO overexpression is primarily mediated by reactive astrocytes. Overall, this study reveals that CNTF induces TSPO in multiple cell types in the rat striatum, through the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in astrocytes, identifying this cell type as the primary mediator of CNTF effects neuroinflammatory processes. Our results highlight the difficulty to interpret TSPO imaging in term of cellular origin without addition cellular analysis by FACS-RTT or quantitative immunostainings.

In the current study, we developed an optogenetic tool for modulating RET signaling, termed optoRET, combining the cytosolic region of human RET with a blue-light–inducible homo-oligomerizing protein. By varying the duration of photoactivation, we were able to dynamically modulate RET signaling. Activation of optoRET recruited Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and stimulated AKT and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) in cultured neurons, evoking robust and efficient ERK activation. By locally activating the distal part of the neuron, we were able to retrogradely transduce the AKT and ERK signal to the soma and trigger formation of filopodia-like F-actin structures at stimulated regions through Cdc42 (cell division control 42) activation. Importantly, we successfully modulated RET signaling in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in the mouse brain. Collectively, optoRET has the potential to be developed as a future therapeutic intervention, modulating RET downstream signaling with light.","Optogenetics, RET, GDNF, PHR, Neuron, Signaling, Actin, AKT, MAPK, ERK, TrkB, Filopodia, Cdc42, Regeneration, Dopaminergic neuron",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01046-6,2023

Bidirectional modulation of somatostatin cell mTORC1 activity, a crucial translational control mechanism in synaptic plasticity, causes parallel changes in hippocampal CA1 somatostatin interneuron (SOM-IN) long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent memory, indicating a key role in learning. However, SOM-IN activity changes and behavioral correlates during learning, and the role of mTORC1 in these processes, remain ill-defined. To address these questions, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging from SOM-INs during a virtual reality goal-directed spatial memory task in head-fixed control mice (SOM-IRES-Cre mice) or in mice with conditional knockout of Rptor (SOM-Rptor-KO mice) to block mTORC1 activity in SOM-INs. We found that control mice learn the task, but SOM-Raptor-KO mice exhibit a deficit. Also, SOM-IN Ca2+ activity became increasingly related to reward during learning in control mice but not in SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Four types of SOM-IN activity patterns related to reward location were observed, “reward off sustained”, “reward off transient”, “reward on sustained” and “reward on transient”, and these responses showed reorganization after reward relocation in control but not SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Thus, SOM-INs develop mTORC1-dependent reward- related activity during learning. This coding may bi-directionally interact with pyramidal cells and other structures to represent and consolidate reward location.","Hippocampus, Somatostatin interneuron, In vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging, Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), Virtual reality, Spatial memory task, Goal-directed task, Reward-related activity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01042-w,2023

The lateral habenula nucleus (LHb) encodes negative emotions in the epithalamus and has been implicated in pain and analgesia. Nevertheless, the role of the lateral habenula nucleus in the pruritic sensation and emotion remains elusive. Here we defined the crucial role of glutamatergic neurons within the lateral habenula nucleus (GluLHb) in itch modulation in mice. We established histamine-dependent and histamine-independent models of acute pruritus, as well as the acetone-ether-water (AEW) model of chronic pruritus. We first assessed the effects of pruritogen injection on neural activation in both medial and lateral divisions of LHb in vitro. We then demonstrated that the population activity of GluLHb neurons was increased during the acute itch and chronic itch-induced scratching behaviors in vivo. In addition, electrophysiological data showed that the excitability of GluLHb neurons was enhanced by chronic itch. Chemogenetic suppression of GluLHb neurons disrupted both acute and chronic itch-evoked scratching behaviors. Furthermore, itch-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA) was abolished by GluLHb neuronal inhibition. Finally, we dissected the LHb upstream brain regions. Together, these findings reveal the involvement of LHb in processing both the sensational and emotional components of pruritus and may shed new insights into itch therapy.","Lateral habenula nucleus, Glutamatergic neurons, Acute itch, Chronic itch",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01045-7,2023

Using single-cell data, we have identified seven different states of NSCs and found that state 4 is closely associated with the development of projection neurons. By inferring the developmental trajectory of different neuronal subtypes from NSC subsets of this state, we discovered that BCAT1 is involved in the regulation of NSC proliferation and differentiation and is specifically highly expressed in layer II/III and IV neurons.

Thus, we examined the effects of diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, on depressive-like behavior using behavioral, pharmacological, and biochemical assays. To determine whether DIZE or Ang (1–7) produce antidepressant-like effects, we measured the duration of immobility of mice in the tail suspension test following their intracerebroventricular administration. Next, we measured the levels of ACE2 activation in the cerebral cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala after DIZE injection, and examined which cell types, including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, express ACE2 in the hippocampus using immunofluorescence. Administration of DIZE or Ang (1–7) significantly shortened the duration of immobility time in the tail suspension test, while this effect was inhibited by the co-administration of the MAS receptor antagonist A779. DIZE activated ACE2 in the hippocampus. ACE2 was localized to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the hippocampus. In conclusion, these results suggest that DIZE may act on ACE2-positive cells in the hippocampus where it increases the activity of ACE2, thereby enhancing signaling of the ACE2/Ang (1–7)/MAS receptor pathway and resulting in antidepressant-like effects.","Antidepressant, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, Ang (1–7), Diminazene, MAS receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01040-y,2023

Here, we used in vivo calcium imaging to examine how ACC neurons in free-moving mice react to pruritogenic histamine. In particular, we focused on how the activity of the ACC neurons varied before and after the scratching response. We discovered that although the change in neuronal activity was not synchronized with the scratching reaction, the overall activity of itch-responsive neurons promptly decreased after the scratching response.

But it raises great attentions recently since this region manifests the indispensable role in social memory. Its unique physical position connecting CA1 and CA3 suggests the potential novel functions besides social memory regulation. But the CA2 is too small to be accurately targeted. A flexible AAV tool capable of accurately and efficiently targeting this region is highly demanded. To fill this gap, we generate an AAV expressing Cre driven by the mini Map3k15 promoter, AAV/M1-Cre, which can be easily utilized to help tracing and manipulating CA2 pyramidal neurons. However, M1-Cre labeled a small percentage of M1+RGS14− neurons that do not colocalize with any RGS14+/STEP+/PEP4+/Amigo2+ pyramidal neurons. They are proved to be the mixture of normal CA2 pyramidal neurons, CA3-like neurons in CA2-CA3 mixed border, some CA2 interneurons and rarely few CA1-like neurons, which are probably the ones projecting to the revealed CA2 downstream targets, VMH, STHY and PMV in WT mice injecting this AAV/M1-Cre virus but not in Amigo2-Cre mice.

Recent genetic studies have identified a convergence of ASD risk genes in deep layer pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex. Here, we use retrograde recombinant adeno-associated viruses to label specifically two major layer V pyramidal neuron types of the medial prefrontal cortex: the commissural neurons, which put the two cerebral hemispheres in direct communication, and the corticopontine neurons, which transmit information outside the cortex. We compare the basal dendritic spines on commissural and corticopontine neurons in WT and KO mice for the ASD risk gene Itgb3, which encodes for the cell adhesion molecule β3 integrin selectively enriched in layer V pyramidal neurons. Regardless of the genotype, corticopontine neurons had a higher ratio of stubby to mushroom spines than commissural neurons. β3 integrin affected selectively spine length in corticopontine neurons. Ablation of β3 integrin resulted in corticopontine neurons lacking long (> 2 μm) thin dendritic spines. These findings suggest that a deficiency in β3 integrin expression compromises specifically immature spines on corticopontine neurons, thereby reducing the cortical territory they can sample. Because corticopontine neurons receive extensive local and long-range excitatory inputs before relaying information outside the cortex, specific alterations in dendritic spines of corticopontine neurons may compromise the computational output of the full cortex, thereby contributing to ASD pathophysiology.","Itgb3, Medial prefrontal cortex, ASD, Dendritic spines, Retrograde labelling",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01031-z,2023

Although social deficits are at the core of the clinical diagnosis of ASD, very little is known about their neural correlates at the time of clinical onset. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region extensively implicated in social behavior, undergoes synaptic, cellular and molecular alterations in early life, and is particularly affected in ASD mouse models. To explore a link between the maturation of the NAc and neurodevelopmental deficits in social behavior, we compared spontaneous synaptic transmission in NAc shell medium spiny neurons (MSNs) between the highly social C57BL/6J and the idiopathic ASD mouse model BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J at postnatal day (P) 4, P6, P8, P12, P15, P21 and P30. BTBR NAc MSNs display increased spontaneous excitatory transmission during the first postnatal week, and increased inhibition across the first, second and fourth postnatal weeks, suggesting accelerated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs compared to C57BL/6J mice. BTBR mice also show increased optically evoked medial prefrontal cortex-NAc paired pulse ratios at P15 and P30. These early changes in synaptic transmission are consistent with a potential critical period, which could maximize the efficacy of rescue interventions. To test this, we treated BTBR mice in either early life (P4-P8) or adulthood (P60-P64) with the mTORC1 antagonist rapamycin, a well-established intervention for ASD-like behavior.

Induction of Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses required at least three postsynaptic APs at Finit higher than 100 Hz, which was met in BS but not in RS cells. The synaptically evoked burst firing was critically dependent on persistent Na+ current, which was larger in BS than RS cells. The Ca2+ source for Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses was primarily provided by L-type calcium channels. In contrast, Hebbian LTP at medial PP synapses was mediated by T-type calcium channels, and could be induced regardless of cell types or Finit of postsynaptic APs.

A recent genetic study reported that the GLRA4 pseudogene locus on the X chromosome is potentially involved in cognitive impairment, motor delay and craniofacial anomalies in humans. The physiologic roles of GlyR α4 in mammal behavior and its involvement in disease, however, are not known. Here we examined the temporal and spatial expression profile of GlyR α4 in the mouse brain and subjected Glra4 mutant mice to a comprehensive behavioral analysis to elucidate the role of GlyR α4 in behavior. The GlyR α4 subunit was mainly enriched in the hindbrain and midbrain, and had relatively lower expression in the thalamus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb. In addition, expression of the GlyR α4 subunit gradually increased during brain development. Glra4 mutant mice exhibited a decreased amplitude and delayed onset of the startle response compared with wild-type littermates, and increased social interaction in the home cage during the dark period. Glra4 mutants also had a low percentage of entries into open arms in the elevated plus-maze test.

Endogenous activity of interneuronal GluK1 KARs maintains the frequency and duration of spontaneous neonatal network bursts and restrains their propagation through the hippocampal network. In adult male mice, the absence of GluK1 in GABAergic neurons led to stronger hippocampal gamma oscillations and enhanced theta-gamma cross frequency coupling, coinciding with faster spatial relearning in the Barnes maze. In females, loss of interneuronal GluK1 resulted in shorter sharp wave ripple oscillations and slightly impaired abilities in flexible sequencing task. In addition, ablation of interneuronal GluK1 resulted in lower general activity and novel object avoidance, while causing only minor anxiety phenotype.

Educational inequality is a universal issue that influences populations’ stroke risk. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between education and stroke risk and the contributions of effects mediated by four modifiable factors.Materials and methodsPublic large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data associated with educational attainment, hypertensive diseases, body mass index (BMI), smoking behavior, time spent on watching the television (TV), and stroke were obtained from European ancestry. The data were used to investigate the causal relationship among educational attainment, hypertensive disease, BMI, smoking, watching TV, and stroke risk. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as a primary algorithm for estimating causal direction and effect size in univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.ResultsHigher educational attainment was a causal protective factor, while hypertensive diseases, higher BMI, smoking, and longer time spent on watching the TV were all causal risk factors for the risk of stroke. Hypertensive disease, BMI, smoking, and watching TV were all mediators for linking the causal relationship between educational attainment and stroke risk. Hypertensive disease, BMI, smoking, and watching TV explained 47.35%, 24.74%, 15.72%, and 2.29% of the variance in educational attainment’s effect on stroke risk, respectively. The explained proportion reached 69.32% after integrating the four factors.ConclusionsThese findings support the causal effect of educational attainment on the risk of stroke, with a substantial proportion mediated by modifiable risk factors. Interventions on these modifiable factors would lead to substantial reductions in stroke cases attributable to educational inequality.","Stroke, Educational attainment, Mendelian randomization, Proportion mediated, Genome-wide association study, Single-nucleotide polymorphisms",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01030-0,2023

The recently developed flexible micro (μ)-electrocorticography (μECoG) device is one prominent method used to examine large-scale cortical activity across multiple regions. The sheet-shaped μECoG electrodes arrays can be placed on a relatively wide area of cortical surface beneath the skull by inserting the device into the space between skull and brain. Although rats and mice are useful tools for neuroscience, current μECoG recording methods in these animals are limited to the parietal region of cerebral cortex. Recording cortical activity from the temporal region of cortex in mice has proven difficult because of surgical barriers created by the skull and surrounding temporalis muscle anatomy. Here, we developed a sheet-shaped 64-channel μECoG device that allows access to the mouse temporal cortex, and we determined the factor determining the appropriate bending stiffness for the μECoG electrode array. We also established a surgical technique to implant the electrode arrays into the epidural space over a wide area of cerebral cortex covering from the barrel field to olfactory (piriform) cortex, which is the deepest region of the cerebral cortex. Using histology and computed tomography (CT) images, we confirmed that the tip of the μECoG device reached to the most ventral part of cerebral cortex without causing noticeable damage to the brain surface. Moreover, the device simultaneously recorded somatosensory and odor stimulus-evoked neural activity from dorsal and ventral parts of cerebral cortex in awake and anesthetized mice. These data indicate that our μECoG device and surgical techniques enable the recording of large-scale cortical activity from the parietal to temporal cortex in mice, including somatosensory and olfactory cortices. This system will provide more opportunities for the investigation of physiological functions from wider areas of the mouse cerebral cortex than those currently available with existing ECoG techniques.","Electrocorticography, Flexible micro-electrocorticography device, Multi-sensory, Cerebral cortex, Temporal cortex, Local field potential",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01019-9,2023

This study aimed to analyze the underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenesis of PND. Tibial fracture surgery was performed in elderly mice to generate a PND model in vivo. Cognitive behavior was evaluated 3 days post-surgery using novel object recognition and fear conditioning. A gradual increase in the SOX2OT mRNA level and decrease in the SOX2 mRNA level were noted, with impaired cognitive function, in the mice 3 days after tibial surgery compared with mice in the sham group. To evaluate the role of SOX2OT in PND, SOX2OT knockdown was performed in vitro and in vivo using lentivirus transfection in HT22 cells and via brain stereotactic injection of lentivirus, respectively. SOX2OT knockdown reduced apoptosis, inhibited oxidative stress, suppressed mitochondrial hyperdivision, attenuated surgery-induced cognitive dysfunction, and promoted downstream SOX2 expression in elderly mice. Furthermore, Sox2 alleviated mitochondrial functional damage by inhibiting the transcription of mitochondrial division protein Drp1. Our study findings indicate that SOX2OT knockout alleviates surgery-induced mitochondrial fission and cognitive function defects by upregulating the expression of Sox2 in mice, resulting in the inhibition of drp1 transcription. Therefore, regulation of the SOX2/Drp1 pathway may be a potential mechanism for the treatment of patients with PND.","Postoperative neurocognitive disorder, Mitochondrial dynamics, Oxidative stress, SOX2OT, SOX2, Drp1",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01024-y,2023

Mice genetically deficient in 5-HTT expression have been used to study the physiological functions of 5-HTT in the brain and have been proposed as a potential animal model for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent studies have provided evidence for a link between the gut-brain axis and mood disorders. However, the effects of 5-HTT deficiency on gut microbiota, brain function, and behavior remain to be fully characterized. Here we investigated the effects of 5-HTT deficiency on different types of behavior, the gut microbiome, and brain c-Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation in response to the forced swim test for assessing depression-related behavior in male 5-HTT knockout mice. Behavioral analysis using a battery of 16 different tests showed that 5-HTT−/− mice exhibited markedly reduced locomotor activity, decreased pain sensitivity, reduced motor function, increased anxiety-like and depression-related behavior, altered social behavior in novel and familiar environments, normal working memory, enhanced spatial reference memory, and impaired fear memory compared to 5-HTT+/+ mice. 5-HTT+/− mice showed slightly reduced locomotor activity and impaired social behavior compared to 5-HTT+/+ mice. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed that 5-HTT−/− mice had altered gut microbiota abundances, such as a decrease in Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Turicibacter, compared to 5-HTT+/+ mice. This study also showed that after exposure to the forced swim test, the number of c-Fos-positive cells was higher in the paraventricular thalamus and lateral hypothalamus and was lower in the prefrontal cortical regions, nucleus accumbens shell, dorsolateral septal nucleus, hippocampal regions, and ventromedial hypothalamus in 5-HTT−/− mice than in 5-HTT+/+ mice. These phenotypes of 5-HTT−/− mice partially recapitulate clinical observations in humans with major depressive disorder. The present findings indicate that 5-HTT-deficient mice serve as a good and valid animal model to study anxiety and depression with altered gut microbial composition and abnormal neuronal activity in the brain, highlighting the importance of 5-HTT in brain function and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of anxiety and depression.","Serotonin transporter, Anxiety, Depression, Behavioral test battery, Gut microbiota, c-Fos, Mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01020-2,2023

While the affective valence of taste signals is supposed to be innately determined, taste preference can also be drastically modified by previous taste experiences of the animals. However, how the experience-dependent taste preference is developed and the neuronal mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of prolonged exposure to umami and bitter tastants on taste preference using two-bottle tests in male mice. Prolonged umami exposure significantly enhanced umami preference with no changes in bitter preference, while prolonged bitter exposure significantly decreased bitter avoidance with no changes in umami preference. Because the central amygdala (CeA) is postulated as a critical node for the valence processing of sensory information including taste, we examined the responses of cells in the CeA to sweet, umami, and bitter tastants using in vivo calcium imaging. Interestingly, both protein kinase C delta (Prkcd)-positive and Somatostatin (Sst)-positive neurons in the CeA showed an umami response comparable to the bitter response, and no difference in cell type-specific activity patterns to different tastants was observed. Meanwhile, fluorescence in situ hybridization with c-Fos antisense probe revealed that a single umami experience significantly activates the CeA and several other gustatory-related nuclei, and especially CeA Sst-positive neurons were strongly activated. Intriguingly, after prolonged umami experience, umami tastant also significantly activates the CeA neurons, but the Prkcd-positive neurons instead of Sst-positive neurons were highly activated. These results suggest a relationship between amygdala activity and experience-dependent plasticity developed in taste preference and the involvement of the genetically defined neural populations in this process.","Gustatory circuit, Umami, Bitter, Amygdala, Taste preference, Plasticity, Calcium imaging",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01017-x,2023

Additionally, an untargeted metabolomics approach was used to compare the serum metabolite profiles of both groups. Meanwhile, the association among serum metabolites, the gut microbiota, and clinical parameters (including injury duration and neurological grade) was also analyzed. Finally, metabolites with the potential for use in the treatment of SCI were identified based on the differential metabolite abundance analysis.ResultsThe composition of the gut microbiota was different between patients with SCI and healthy controls. At the genus level, compared with the control group, the abundance of UBA1819, Anaerostignum, Eggerthella, and Enterococcus was significantly increased in the SCI group, whereas that of Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Escherichia–Shigella, Agathobacter, Collinsella, Dorea, Ruminococcus, Fusicatenibacter, and Eubacterium was decreased. Forty-one named metabolites displayed significant differential abundance between SCI patients and healthy controls, including 18 that were upregulated and 23 that were downregulated.

In the current study, we use a microvasculature model, where human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) are co-cultured together with human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, to demonstrate that IAPP oligomers (oIAPP) alter the morphology and contractility of HBVP. Contraction and relaxation of HBVP was verified using the vasoconstrictor sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and vasodilator Y27632, where the former increased, and the latter decreased, the number of HBVP with round morphology. Increased number of round HBVP was also seen after oIAPP stimulation, and the effect was reverted by the IAPP analogue pramlintide, Y27632, and the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. Inhibition of the IAPP receptor with the antagonist AC187 only reverted IAPP effects partially. Finally, we demonstrate by immunostaining of human brain tissue against laminin that individuals with high amount of brain IAPP levels show significantly lower capillary diameter and altered mural cell morphology compared to individuals with low brain IAPP levels. These results indicate that HBVP, in an in vitro model of microvasculature, respond morphologically to vasoconstrictors, dilators, and myosin inhibitors.

We report that conditional knockout (cKO) of Ggps1 leads to severe ataxia and deficient locomotion. To identify the underlying mechanisms, we completed a series of cellular and molecular experiments. First, our morphological analysis revealed significantly decreased population of granule cell progenitors (GCPs) and impaired proliferation of GCPs in the developing cerebellum of Ggps1 cKO mice. Second, our molecular analysis showed increased expression of p21, an important cell cycle regulator in Ggps1 cKO mice.

Kreutz,kreutz@lin-magdeburg.de,2023-02-11,"Jacob is a synapto-nuclear messenger protein that encodes and transduces the origin of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signals to the nucleus. The protein assembles a signalosome that differs in case of synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDAR activation. Following nuclear import Jacob docks these signalosomes to the transcription factor CREB. We have recently shown that amyloid-β and extrasynaptic NMDAR activation triggers the translocation of a Jacob signalosome that results in inactivation of the transcription factor CREB, a phenomenon termed Jacob-induced CREB shut-off (JaCS). JaCS contributes to early Alzheimer’s disease pathology and the absence of Jacob protects against amyloid pathology. Given that extrasynaptic activity is also involved in acute excitotoxicity, like in stroke, we asked whether nsmf gene knockout will also protect against acute insults, like oxygen and glucose deprivation and excitotoxic NMDA stimulation. nsmf is the gene that encodes for the Jacob protein. Here we show that organotypic hippocampal slices from wild-type and nsmf−/− mice display similar degrees of degeneration when exposed to either oxygen glucose deprivation or 50 µM NMDAto induce excitotoxicity. This lack of neuroprotection indicates that JaCS is mainly relevant in conditions of low level chronic extrasynaptic NMDAR activation that results in cellular degeneration induced by alterations in gene transcription.","Jacob, Nsmf, Oxygen–glucose deprivation, Cell death, Excitoxicity, Extrasynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, Stroke",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01012-2,2023

In this study, we observed that Maged1 was expressed in the dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra in mice and humans, which could be upregulated by the in vivo or in vitro treatment with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+). Genetic ablation of Maged1 in mice attenuated motor deficits, the loss of DA neurons, and disease progression induced by MPTP. Moreover, Maged1 deficiency protected DA neurons against MPP+-induced toxicity in primary cultured cells. Mechanistically, loss of Maged1 upregulated the Akt signaling pathway and downregulated the mTOR signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells, which may in turn attenuate the cell apoptosis and impairment of autophagy. Consistent with it, the degeneration of midbrain and striatum among elderly Maged1 knockout mice was relatively mild compared to those in wild-type mice under physiological conditions.

It encodes the postsynaptic membrane protein Neuroligin4 (NLGN4), the functions and roles of which, however, are not fully understood due to the lack of a closely homologous gene in rodents. It has been confirmed only recently that human NLGN4 is abundantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and is localized mainly to excitatory synapses. However, the detailed histological distribution of NLGN4, which may have important implications regarding the relationships between NLGN4 and autistic phenotypes, has not been clarified. In this study, we raised specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against NLGN4 and examined the distribution of NLGN4 in developing and developed human brains by immunohistochemistry. We found that, in the brain, NLGN4 is expressed almost exclusively in neurons, in which it has a widespread cytoplasmic pattern of distribution. Among various types of neurons with NLGN4 expression, we identified consistently high expression of NLGN4 in hypothalamic oxytocin (OXT)/vasopressin (AVP)-producing cells. Quantitative analyses revealed that the majority of OXT/AVP-producing neurons expressed NLGN4. NLGN4 signals in other large neurons, such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as well as neurons in the locus coeruleus and the raphe nucleus, were also remarkable, clearly contrasting with no or scarce signals in Purkinje cells.

We found that tumor growth was dramatically promoted in these pain models. As well as these pain models, tumor growth of LLC, severe osteosarcoma (AXT) and B16 melanoma cells was significantly promoted by concomitant activation of sensory neurons in AAV6-hM3Dq-injected mice treated with the designer drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO).

The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus plays an important role in the adaptation to stress because the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis can be activated by inducing the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the PVN. In this study, we used pharmacogenetic techniques to investigate whether concomitant activation of CRHPVN neurons could directly contribute to tumor progression. Tumor growth was significantly promoted by repeated activation of CRHPVN neurons, which was followed by an increase in the plasma levels of corticosterone. Consistent with these results, chronic administration of glucocorticoids induced tumor progression. Under the concomitant activation of CRHPVN neurons, the number of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment was dramatically decreased, and the mRNA expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit α (HIF1α), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and Tsc22d3 were upregulated in inhibitory lymphocytes, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of various kinds of driver molecules related to tumor progression and tumor metastasis were prominently elevated in cancer cells by concomitant activation of CRHPVN neurons.

Previous studies of PS function in the hippocampus demonstrated that loss of PS results in the impairment of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release at hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC) and mossy fiber (MF) synapses. Cortical input to the hippocampus through the lateral perforant pathway (LPP) and the medial perforant pathway (MPP) is critical for normal cognitive functions and is particularly vulnerable during aging and early stages of AD. Whether PS regulates synaptic function in the perforant pathways, however, remained unknown. In the current study, we investigate PS function in the LPP and MPP by performing whole-cell and field-potential electrophysiological recordings using acute hippocampal slices from postnatal forebrain-restricted excitatory neuron-specific PS conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. We found that paired-pulse ratio (PPR) is reduced in the LPP and MPP of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, synaptic frequency facilitation or depression in the LPP or MPP, respectively, is impaired in PS cDKO mice. Notably, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibition of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) minics and occludes the effects of PS inactivation, as evidenced by decreases of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) amplitude in the LPP and MPP of control neurons but no effect on the EPSC amplitude in PS cDKO neurons, suggesting that impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis in the absence of PS may contribute to the observed deficits in synaptic transmission. While spontaneous synaptic events, such as both the frequency and the amplitude of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, are similar between PS cDKO and control neurons, long-term potentiation (LTP) is impaired in the LPP and MPP of PS cDKO mice, accompanied with reduction of evoked NMDA receptor-mediated responses. These findings show the importance of PS in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and intracellular calcium homeostasis in the hippocampal perforant pathways.","Alzheimer’s disease, Conditional knockout, Hippocampus, Perforant pathways, Short-term synaptic plasticity, Long-term potentiation, Calcium homeostasis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01009-x,2023

Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are also innervated by the temporoammonic (TA) pathway, and excitatory TA-CA1 synapses are reported to be regulated by E2. Recent studies suggest a role for the novel G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) at SC-CA1 synapses, however, the role of GPER1 in mediating the effects of E2 at juvenile TA-CA1 synapses is unclear. Here we demonstrate that the GPER1 agonist, G1 induces a persistent, concentration-dependent (1–10 nM) increase in excitatory synaptic transmission at TA-CA1 synapses and this effect is blocked by selective GPER1 antagonists. The ability of GPER1 to induce this novel form of chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) was prevented following blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and it was not accompanied by any change in paired pulse facilitation ratio (PPR). GPER1-induced cLTP involved activation of ERK but was independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling. Prior treatment with philanthotoxin prevented the effects of G1, indicating that synaptic insertion of GluA2-lacking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors underlies GPER1-induced cLTP. Furthermore, activity-dependent LTP occluded G1‐induced cLTP and vice versa, indicating that these processes have overlapping expression mechanisms. Activity‐dependent LTP was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist, G15, suggesting that GPER1 plays a role in NMDA‐dependent LTP at juvenile TA‐CA1 synapses.

In this BBB model with iBMECs plated on the upper compartment (blood side) and astrocytes plated on the lower compartment (brain side), the trans-endothelial electrical resistance values are high (over 1500 Ωm2) and stable during experiments. We found that the addition of Aβ42 (0.5 and 2 µM) to the brain side significantly reduced the level of flotillin secreted by iBMECs on the blood side. The level of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) in the brain side was significantly reduced by Aβ42 treatment, and was accompanied by a reduction in the level of phosphorylation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor in iBMECs. The brain-side Aβ42 treatment-induced reduction of flotillin secretion into the blood side was restored in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of FGF-2 into the brain side. These results indicated that Aβ accumulation in the brain side reduced FGF-2 release from astrocytes, which attenuated FGF-2-mediated iBMECs signaling via the FGF-2 receptor, and thereby reduced flotillin secretion from iBMECs on the blood side.

The current antiseizure drugs (ASDs) aim to stop seizures quickly enough to prevent the SE-induced brain inflammation, injury, and long-term sequelae. However, sole reliance on acute therapies is imprudent because prompt treatment may not always be possible under certain circumstances. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the devastating consequences of SE are presumably associated with neuroinflammatory reactions, where prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a pivotal role. As the terminal synthase for pathogenic PGE2, the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is rapidly and robustly induced by prolonged seizures. Congenital deletion of mPGES-1 in mice is neuroprotective and blunts gliosis following chemoconvulsant seizures, suggesting the feasibility of mPGES-1 as a potential antiepileptic target. Herein, we investigated the effects of a dual species mPGES-1 inhibitor in a mouse pilocarpine model of SE. Treatment with the mPGES-1 inhibitor in mice after SE that was terminated by diazepam, a fast-acting benzodiazepine, time-dependently abolished the SE-induced PGE2 within the brain. Its negligible effects on cyclooxygenases, the enzymes responsible for the initial step of PGE2 biosynthesis, validated its specificity to mPGES-1. Post-SE inhibition of mPGES-1 also blunted proinflammatory cytokines and reactive gliosis in the hippocampus and broadly prevented neuronal damage in a number of brain areas. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 by small-molecule inhibitors might provide an adjunctive strategy that can be implemented hours after SE, together with first-line ASDs, to reduce SE-provoked brain inflammation and injury.","Antiseizure drugs (ASDs), Epilepsy, Epileptogenesis, Reactive gliosis, Inhibitor, Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), Neuroinflammation, Neuroprotection, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), Seizures",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01008-y,2023

Cell-type-specific translational control of spatial working memory by the cap-binding protein 4EHP,"Shane Wiebe1,2,, Ziying Huang1,2,, Reese Jalal Ladak1,2,, Agnieszka Skalecka1,2,, Roberta Cagnetta1,2,, Jean-Claude Lacaille3,, Argel Aguilar-Valles4 na1 &, Nahum Sonenberg1,2 na1",Nahum Sonenberg,nahum.sonenberg@mcgill.ca,2023-01-18,"The consolidation of learned information into long-lasting memories requires the strengthening of synaptic connections through de novo protein synthesis. Translation initiation factors play a cardinal role in gating the production of new proteins thereby regulating memory formation. Both positive and negative regulators of translation play a critical role in learning and memory consolidation. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) homologous protein (4EHP, encoded by the gene Eif4e2) is a pivotal negative regulator of translation but its role in learning and memory is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we generated excitatory (glutamatergic: CaMKIIα-positive) and inhibitory (GABAergic: GAD65-positive) conditional knockout mice for 4EHP, which were analyzed in various behavioral memory tasks. Knockout of 4EHP in Camk2a-expressing neurons (4EHP-cKOexc) did not impact long-term memory in either contextual fear conditioning or Morris water maze tasks. Similarly, long-term contextual fear memory was not altered in Gad2-directed 4EHP knockout mice (4EHP-cKOinh). However, when subjected to a short-term T-maze working memory task, both mouse models exhibited impaired cognition. We therefore tested the hypothesis that de novo protein synthesis plays a direct role in working memory. We discovered that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a measure of mTORC1 activity, is dramatically reduced in the CA1 hippocampus of 4EHP-cKOexc mice. Consistently, genetic reduction of mTORC1 activity in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons was sufficient to impair working memory. Taken together, these findings indicate that translational control by 4EHP and mTORC1 in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are necessary for working memory.","Glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, eIF4E homologous protein (4EHP), Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-00995-2,2023
Axonal membrane stretch suppresses neuronal excitability by activating mechanosensitive K2P channels at the node of Ranvier,"Hirosato Kanda

Recently, we demonstrated that K2P channels, TWIK-related K+ channel-1 (TREK-1), and TWIK-related arachidonic acid-activated K + channel (TRAAK), are highly expressed in the mammalian node of Ranvier of sensory nerves and have an important role in action potential repolarization instead of voltage-gated K+ channels. TREK-1/TRAAK channels are activated by membrane depolarization as well as various stimuli, such as temperature, pH, arachidonic acid, and mechanical membrane stretch. Although membrane mechanical stretch has been suggested to modulate action potential conduction, how membrane stretching modulates intrinsic electrophysiological properties at the node of Ranvier remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of membrane stretch on neuronal membranes at the node of Ranvier in rat sciatic nerves. The single-channel conductance was approximately 90 pS at 80 mV. Membrane stretch increased the single-channel event numbers and open probability in a pressure-dependent manner. Consistent with single-channel activity, intra-pipette positive pressure increased outward leak currents and decreased membrane excitability in a whole-cell configuration. Furthermore, blockage of TREK-1/TRAAK channels by Ba2+ reversed the changes in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties induced by intra-pipette pressure. These results indicate that the activation of mechanosensitive TREK-1/TRAAK channels may suppress neuronal excitability following axonal stretch. Our findings suggest that TREK-1/TRAAK channels may play an important role in the prevention of ectopic action potential discharge at the axon by intense mechanical nerve stretch under physiological conditions.","Node of Ranvier, Two-pore-domain potassium channels, Membrane stretch, Action potential, Single-channel activity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01000-6,2023

A critical role in this degenerative process is assumed by enzymes such as the kinase Fyn and its counterpart, the phosphatase striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP61). Whereas the role of Fyn has been widely explored, less is known about STEP61 that localises to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic neurons. In dementias, synaptic loss is associated with an increased burden of pathological aggregates. Tau pathology is a hallmark of both AD (together with amyloid-β deposition) and FTD-tau. Here, we examined STEP61 and its activity in human and animal brain tissue and observed a correlation between STEP61 and disease progression. In early-stage human AD, an initial increase in the level and activity of STEP61 was observed, which decreased with the loss of the synaptic marker PSD-95; in FTD-tau, there was a reduction in STEP61 and PSD-95 which correlated with clinical diagnosis. In APP23 mice with an amyloid-β pathology, the level and activity of STEP61 were increased in the synaptic fraction compared to wild-type littermates. Similarly, in the K3 mouse model of FTD-tau, which we assessed at two ages compared to wild-type, expression and activity of STEP61 were increased with ageing. Together, these findings suggest that STEP contributes differently to the pathogenic process in AD and FTD-tau, and that its activation may be an early response to a degenerative process.","Alzheimer’s disease, Amyloid-β, Frontotemporal dementia, Striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP61), Microtubule-associated protein tau, Transgenic mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-00994-3,2023

The circadian rhythm is a timed transcription-translation feedback loop with positive regulators, BMAL1 and CLOCK, that interact with negative regulators, CRY and PER, to regulate both the central and peripheral clocks. This review highlights the functions of the circadian rhythm, specifically in the blood–brain barrier (BBB), during both healthy and pathological states. The BBB is a highly selective dynamic interface composed of CNS endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and microglia that form the neurovascular unit (NVU). Circadian rhythms modulate BBB integrity through regulating oscillations of tight junction proteins, assisting in functions of the NVU, and modulating transporter functions. Circadian disruptions within the BBB have been observed in stress responses and several neurological disorders, including brain metastasis, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Further understanding of these interactions may facilitate the development of improved treatment options and preventative measures.","Circadian rhythm, Blood–brain barrier, Brain, Neurological disorders, Stress responses",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-00997-0,2023

In the present study, we investigated synaptic tagging in adult and middle-aged mice's anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using the 64-channel multielectrode dish (MED64) recording system. We found that synaptic tagging was impaired in the ACC of middle-aged male mice as compared to adult mice.

Similar results were found in female middle-aged mice, indicating that there is no gender difference. Furthermore, bath application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or systemic treatment with newly developed TrkB receptor agonists R13, was shown to rescue both synaptic tagging, and L-LTP, in middle-aged mice. To determine the distribution of synaptic LTP within the ACC, a new visualization method was developed to map the Spatio-temporal variation of LTP in the ACC.

However, the temporal processing of nociceptive inputs in the cortex remains little studied. Here, we took two approaches to examine how nociceptive inputs are processed by the S1 and ACC. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in both regions, during the application of a brain-computer interface (BCI). First, we compared event related potentials in the S1 and ACC. Next, we used an algorithmic pain decoder enabled by machine-learning to detect the onset of pain which was used during the implementation of the BCI to automatically treat pain.

Although, it remains unknown if SOM-IN activity and LTP are necessary and sufficient for novelty motivated spatial episodic memory such as the object location memory, and if so when it is required. Here we use optogenetics to examine whether dorsal CA1 SOM-IN activity and LTP are sufficient to regulate object location memory.

Second, optogenetic induction of PC-SOM synapse LTP (TBSopto) given 30 min before object location training, resulted in facilitation of memory. However, in mice with mTORC1 pathway genetically inactivated in SOM-INs, which blocks PC-SOM synapse LTP, TBSopto failed to facilitate object location memory.

This typically causes a reduction in calcium currents, triggering changes in presynaptic calcium levels and thus neurotransmission. Because of the widespread expression patterns of NOP and VGCCs across multiple brain regions, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and the dorsal root ganglia, this results in the alteration of numerous neurophysiological features. Here we review the regulation of N-type calcium channels by the NOP-nociceptin system in the context of neurological conditions such as anxiety, addiction, and pain.","Anxiety, Learning, ORL-1, Opioid receptor, Pain, G protein-coupled receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00982-z,2022

Forebrain-specific conditional Cn knockout mice have been known to exhibit multiple behavioral phenotypes related to these disorders. In this study, we investigated whether Cn mutant mice show pseudo-immaturity of the dentate gyrus (iDG) in the hippocampus, which we have proposed as an endophenotype shared by these disorders. Expression of calbindin and GluA1, typical markers for mature DG granule cells (GCs), was decreased and that of doublecortin, calretinin, phospho-CREB, and dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1), markers for immature GC, was increased in Cn mutants. Phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates (GluA1, ERK2, DARPP-32, PDE4) was increased and showed higher sensitivity to SKF81297, a Drd1-like agonist, in Cn mutants than in controls. While cAMP/PKA signaling is increased in the iDG of Cn mutants, chronic treatment with rolipram, a selective PDE4 inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, ameliorated the iDG phenotype significantly and nesting behavior deficits with nominal significance. Chronic rolipram administration also decreased the phosphorylation of CREB, but not the other four PKA substrates examined, in Cn mutants. These results suggest that Cn deficiency induces pseudo-immaturity of GCs and that cAMP signaling increases to compensate for this maturation abnormality. This study further supports the idea that iDG is an endophenotype shared by certain neuropsychiatric disorders.","Calcineurin, Immature dentate gyrus, Dopamine receptor, cAMP, Intellectual disability, Mouse model",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00981-0,2022

Using an enriched environment (EE) paradigm, we have recently demonstrated that enhancing social, physical, and sensory activity during the pre-weaning time in mice led to an increase of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. The structural plasticity induced by experience may affect information processing in the circuit. The DG performs pattern separation, a computation that enables the encoding of very similar and overlapping inputs into dissimilar outputs. In the presented study, we have tested the hypothesis that an EE in juvenile mice will affect DG’s functions that are relevant for pattern separation: the decorrelation of the inputs from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the recruitment of the principal excitatory granule cell (GC) during behavior. First, using a novel slice electrophysiology protocol, we found that the transformation of the incoming signal from the EC afferents by individual GC is moderately affected by EE. We further show that EE does not affect behaviorally induced recruitment of principal excitatory GC. Lastly, using the novel object recognition task, a hippocampus-dependent memory test, we show that the ontogeny of this discrimination task was similar among the EE mice and the controls. Taken together, our work demonstrates that pre-weaning enrichment moderately affects DG function.","Dentate gyrus, Hippocampus, Plasticity, Memory discrimination, Postnatal development, Enriched environment, Pattern separation, Behavior",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00980-1,2022

While most cases occur in a sporadic manner and are accompanied by intracranial vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root, alteration of ion channels has emerged as a potential exacerbating factor. Recently, whole exome sequencing analysis of familial TN patients identified 19 rare variants in the gene CACNA1H encoding for Cav3.2T-type calcium channels. An initial analysis of 4 of these variants pointed to a pathogenic role. In this study, we assessed the electrophysiological properties of 13 additional TN-associated Cav3.2 variants expressed in tsA-201 cells. Our data indicate that 6 out of the 13 variants analyzed display alteration of their gating properties as evidenced by a hyperpolarizing shift of their voltage dependence of activation and/or inactivation resulting in an enhanced window current supported by Cav3.2 channels. An additional variant enhanced the recovery from inactivation. Simulation of neuronal electrical membrane potential using a computational model of reticular thalamic neuron suggests that TN-associated Cav3.2 variants could enhance neuronal excitability.

In neurons, it has been well established that DA increases or decreases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) through D1-like or D2-like dopamine receptors, respectively. In contrast, it has been elusive how astrocytes respond to DA via Ca2+ signaling and regulate synaptic transmission and reward systems. Previous studies suggest various molecular targets such as MAO-B, D1R, or D1R–D2R heteromer to modulate astrocytic Ca2+ signaling. However, which molecular target is utilized under what physiological condition remains unclear. Here, we show that DA-induced astrocytic Ca2+ signaling pathway switches during development: MAO-B is the major player at a young age (5–6 weeks), whereas DA receptors (DARs) are responsible for the adult period (8–12 weeks). DA-mediated Ca2+ response in the adult period was decreased by either D1R or D2R blockers, which are primarily known for cyclic AMP signaling (Gs and Gi pathway, respectively), suggesting that this Ca2+ response might be mediated through Gq pathway by D1R–D2R heterodimer. Moreover, DAR-mediated Ca2+ response was not blocked by TTX, implying that this response is not a secondary response caused by neuronal activation. Our study proposes an age-specific molecular target of DA-induced astrocytic Ca2+ signaling: MAO-B in young mice and DAR in adult mice.","Dopamine, Astrocyte, Ca2+ response, MAO-B, Dopamine receptors, Development, mPFC",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00977-w,2022

OMP can enter the nucleus in association with transcription factors. However, how OMP is retained in the cytosol at rest is unclear. Because OMP is proposed to affect cell differentiation, it is important to understand how OMP is distributed between cytoplasm and nucleus. To elucidate the structural profile of OMP, we applied several bioinformatics methods to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of OMP protein sequences and ranked the evolutionarily conserved residues. In addition to the previously reported cAMP-binding domain, we identified a leucine-rich domain in the Ω-loop of OMP. We introduced mutations into the leucine-rich region and heterologously expressed the mutant OMP in HEK293T cells.

Using a high-speed volumetric imaging with on-the-fly-scan and Readout (VISoR) technique, we visualized brain-wide axonal projections of individual PPN-targeting neurons from several cortical areas, including the prelimbic region (PL), anterior cingulate area (ACA) and secondary motor cortex (MOs).

In particular, PPN-projecting neurons from all three traced cortical areas exhibited common preferential collateralization to several nuclei, with most neurons targeting the striatum (STR), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and periaqueductal gray (PAG), and a substantial portion of neurons also targeting the zona incerta (ZI), median raphe nucleus (MRN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Meanwhile, very specific collateralization patterns were found for other nuclei, including the intermediate reticular nucleus (IRN), parvicellular reticular nucleus (PARN) and gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GRN), which receive collateral inputs almost exclusively from the MOs.

While the majority (> 90%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92–100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59–64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1–101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., Aβ plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We and others have used transcriptome profiling in AD patient-derived neuron models of autosomal-dominant EOAD and sporadic LOAD to identify disease endotypes (Caldwell et al.

Further, analyses of large postmortem brain cohorts demonstrate that only one-third of AD patients show hallmark disease endotypes like increased inflammation and decreased synaptic signaling (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages—such as the primary visual cortex—exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2009;30:561–73). To this end, we analyzed AD patient samples from the primary visual cortex (19 EOAD, 20 LOAD) using transcriptomic signatures to identify patient clusters and disease endotypes.

To understand the neural mechanism of the state-dependent switch in multisensory decisions, we performed in vivo calcium imaging of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are known to mediate auditory dominance in the resolution of audiovisual conflicts, in mice on the treadmill. In the stationary state, the PPC PV+ neurons showed similar amounts of evoked activity in responses to auditory and visual stimuli and enhanced responses to the multisensory audiovisual stimuli. Conversely, when mice were running on a treadmill, the PV+ neurons lost auditory responses and did not show any multisensory enhancement in their activity. When we optogenetically activated the PPC PV+ neurons in mice freely navigating the T-maze, the mice made more auditory-dominant decisions without changes in unisensory decisions. Our data demonstrate that the PPC PV+ neurons lost their ability to integrate auditory information with the visual one during active navigation.

A persistent form of PC-SOM synapse LTP lasting hours is prevented by blockers of transcription and translation, and a more transient form of PC-SOM synapse LTP lasting tens of minutes requires mTORC1-signaling, suggesting an involvement of protein synthesis. However, the role of protein synthesis in these forms of plasticity has not been directly demonstrated. Here we use the SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET) assay of protein synthesis to directly show that the induction protocols for both forms of LTP at PC-SOM synapses stimulate protein synthesis in SOM-INs. Moreover, protein synthesis stimulated by persistent LTP induction was prevented in mice with a SOM-IN conditional knock-out of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, indicating a critical role of mTORC1 in the control of translation in PC-SOM synapse plasticity. Moreover, protein synthesis induced by both forms of LTP may share common mechanisms as transient LTP induction occluded further stimulation of protein synthesis by persistent LTP induction. Our findings highlight a crucial role of protein synthesis and its control by mTORC1 in SOM-INs that is important for hippocampus-dependent memory function.","GABA interneurons, Hebbian LTP, Late LTP, SUnSET assay, Puromycin translation assay, Raptor, Translation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00967-y,2022

Stereocilin is an essential stereociliary protein in the OHCs, the mutation of which in humans causes autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness. Map1a is a modifier of tubby hearing (moth1), and its wild-type allele, rather than the moth1 allele from the C57BL/6 J strain, restores stereocilin localization to the stereocilia and rescues the hearing impairment of tubby mice. The mechanism by which MAP1A accomplishes this is unclear, partly due to ambiguity regarding whether the tubby mutation is a true null. We therefore generated Tub-null (Tub−/−) mice by deleting exon 3 and found that they exhibit hearing impairment like that of tubby mice, suggesting the tubby mutation is a loss-of-function mutation with regard to hearing. When we crossed Tub−/− mice with AKR mice that have wild-type Map1a alleles, we found that wild-type MAP1A restores stereocilin localization to the tips of stereocilia and rescues hearing impairment. These data suggest MAP1A does not require interaction with tubby protein in maintaining stereocilin at the tips of stereocilia and that OHCs use two independent molecules—MAP1A and tubby—to doubly ensure proper stereocilin localization.","Tubby, MAP1A, Stereocilia, Stereocilin, Cochlear",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00966-z,2022

Some studies have found increased beta amyloid burden is associated with worsening cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease, especially in cases where dementia occurs, while other studies failed to replicate this finding. To better understand this relationship, we examined a cohort of 25 idiopathic Parkinson’s disease patients and 30 healthy controls from the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative database. These participants underwent [18F]Florbetaben positron emission tomography scans to quantify beta amyloid deposition in 20 cortical regions. We then analyzed this beta amyloid data alongside the longitudinal Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores across 3 years to see how participant’s baseline beta amyloid levels affected their cognitive scores prospectively. The first analysis we performed with these data was a hierarchical cluster analysis to help identify brain regions that shared similarity. We found that beta amyloid clusters differently in Parkinson’s disease patients compared to healthy controls. In the Parkinson’s disease group, increased beta amyloid burden in cluster 2 was associated with worse cognitive ability, compared to deposition in clusters 1 or 3. We also performed a stepwise linear regression where we found an adjusted R2 of 0.495 (49.5%) in a model explaining the Parkinson’s disease group’s Montreal Cognitive Assessment score 1-year post-scan, encompassing the left gyrus rectus, the left anterior cingulate cortex, and the right parietal cortex. Taken together, these results suggest regional beta amyloid deposition alone has a moderate effect on predicting future cognitive decline in Parkinson’s disease patients. The patchwork effect of beta amyloid deposition on cognitive ability may be part of what separates cognitive impairment from cognitive sparing in Parkinson’s disease. Thus, we suggest it would be more useful to measure beta amyloid burden in specific brain regions rather than using a whole-brain global beta amyloid composite score and use this information as a tool for determining which Parkinson’s disease patients are most at risk for future cognitive decline.","Parkinson’s disease, Beta amyloid, Cognitive decline, [18F]Florbetaben, PPMI",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00964-1,2022

Animals, including humans, need to behave flexibly to adjust to ever-changing environments. Reversal learning tasks have been used to assess behavioral flexibility in many species. However, there are some limitations in the traditional free-moving methodology, including (1) sessions to train the animals, (2) within-session number of trials associated with reversals, (3) factors of physical movement unrelated to the task in the maze or operant box, and (4) incompatibility with techniques, such as two-photon imaging. Therefore, to address these limitations, we established a novel spatiotemporal Pavlovian head-fixed reversal learning task for mice. Six experimentally naive adult C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. First, we trained head-fixed mice on a fixed-time schedule task. Sucrose solution was delivered every 10 s with a single drinking spout placed within the licking distance of the mice. After the mice showed anticipatory licking toward the timing of sucrose solution delivery, we began training the mice on the fixed-time schedule reversal learning task with two licking spouts. In this task, sucrose solution was delivered through one of the two drinking spouts. The rewarding spout was switched every 10 trials. Mice quickly learned to switch anticipatory licking to the rewarding side of the spouts, suggesting that they learned this head-fixed reversal learning task. Using the head-fixed experimental design, behavioral measures can be simplified by eliminating the complex behavioral sequences observed in free-moving animals. This novel head-fixed reversal learning task is a useful assay for studying the neurobiological mechanism of behavioral flexibility that is impaired in various psychopathological conditions.","Reversal learning, Behavioral flexibility, Head-fixed, Pavlovian conditioning, Mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00952-5,2022

However, the causal relationship between nicotinic receptor activity and behavior remains unclear. Contrary to the studies that examined the functions of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the role of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on behavior has not been examined as extensively. Here, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection of mecamylamine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, on the performance of male mice in a head-fixed temporal conditioning task and a free-moving open-field task. The head-fixed experimental setup allowed us to record and precisely quantify the licking response while the mice performed the behavioral task with no external cues. In addition, by combining the utility of the head-fixed experimental design with computer vision analysis based on deep learning algorithms, we succeeded in quantifying the eyelid size of awake mice. In the temporal conditioning task, we delivered a 10% sucrose solution every 10 s using a blunt-tipped needle placed within the licking distance of the mice. After the training, the mice showed increased anticipatory licking toward the timing of sucrose delivery, suggesting that the mice could predict the timing of the reward. Systemic injection of mecamylamine decreased licking behavior and caused eye closure but had no effect on learned conditioned predictive behavior in the head-fixed temporal conditioning task. In addition, the injection of mecamylamine decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner in the free-moving open-field task. The results in the open-field experiments further revealed that the effect of mecamylamine on fecal output and urination, suggesting the effects on autonomic activities. Our achievement of successful eyelid size recording has potential as a useful approach in initial screening for drug discovery.

However, relatively little is known about the changes in circuit function during the progression of motor deficit in this model. As the motor cortex is the key node in the motor system for the control of voluntary movement, we measured firing activity in populations of motor cortical neurons during locomotion on a motorized wheel-treadmill. Different populations of neurons intermingled in the motor cortex signal different aspects of the locomotor state of the animal. The proportion of running selective neurons whose activity positively correlates with locomotion speed gradually decreases with weekly training in wild-type mice, but not in Mecp2-null mice. The fraction of rest-selective neurons whose activity negatively correlates with locomotion speed does not change with training in wild-type mice, but is higher and increases with the progression of locomotion deficit in mutant mice. The synchronization of population activity that occurs in WT mice with training did not occur in Mecp2-null mice, a phenotype most clear during locomotion and observable across all functional cell types.

It has previously been reported that persistent pain may be mediated by the immune and inflammatory systems. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a significant role in immune and inflammatory responses and are expressed by microglia and astrocytes. One of the fundamental mechanisms of the innate immune system in coordinating inflammatory signal transduction is through TLRs, which protect the host organism by initiating inflammatory signaling cascades in response to tissue damage or stress. TLRs reside at the neuroimmune interface, and accumulating evidence has suggested that the inflammatory consequences of TLR activation on glia (mainly microglia and astrocytes), sensory neurons, and other cell types can influence nociceptive processing and lead to pain. Several studies have shown that TLRs may play a key role in neuropathic pain and migraine etiology by activating the microglia. The pathogenesis of migraine may involve a TLR-mediated crosstalk between neurons and immune cells. Innate responses in the central nervous system (CNS) occur during neuroinflammatory phenomena, including migraine. Antigens found in the environment play a crucial role in the inflammatory response, causing a broad range of diseases, including migraines. These can be recognized by several innate immune cells, including macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells, and can be activated through TLR signaling. Given the prevalence of migraine and the insufficient efficacy and safety of current treatment options, a deeper understanding of TLRs is expected to provide novel therapies for managing chronic migraine. This review aimed to justify the view that TLRs may be involved in migraine.","Migraine, TLRs, Microglia, Inflammatory response",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00960-5,2022

Ubiquitination, which can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays important roles during brain development. Furthermore, deregulation of the Ub system is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. We used a publicly available RNA-seq database to perform an extensive genome-wide gene expression analysis of the core components of the ubiquitination machinery, covering Ub genes as well as E1, E2, E3 and DUB genes. The ubiquitination network was governed by only Uba1 and Ube2m, the predominant E1 and E2 genes, respectively; their expression was positively regulated during cortical formation. The principal genes encoding HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus), RBR (RING-in-between-RING), and RING (really interesting new gene) E3 Ub ligases were also highly regulated. Pja1, Dtx3 (RING ligases) and Stub1 (U-box RING) were the most highly expressed E3 Ub ligase genes and displayed distinct developmental expression patterns.

Hence, whether there is another typical animal model for mimicking PFBC phenotypes in an early stage still remained unknown. In this study, we profiled the mRNA expression pattern of myorg in zebrafish, and used a morpholino-mediated blocking strategy to knockdown myorg mRNA at splicing and translation initiation levels. We observed multiple calcifications throughout the brain by calcein staining at 2–4 days post-fertilization in myorg-deficient zebrafish, and rescued the calcification phenotype by replenishing myorg cDNA.

However, functions of these channels at NRs remain elusive. In the present study, we addressed this issue by directly applying whole-cell patch-clamp recordings at NRs of rat lumbar spinal ventral nerves in ex vivo preparations. We show that depolarizing voltages evoke large non-inactivating outward currents at NRs, which are partially inhibited by KCNQ channel blocker linopirdine and potentiated by KCNQ channel activator retigabine. Furthermore, linopirdine significantly alters intrinsic electrophysiological properties of NRs to depolarize resting membrane potential, increase input resistance, prolong AP width, reduce AP threshold, and decrease AP amplitude. On the other hand, retigabine significantly decreases input resistance and increases AP rheobase at NRs. Moreover, linopirdine increases excitability at NRs by converting single AP firing into multiple AP firing at many NRs. Saltatory conduction velocity is significantly reduced by retigabine, and AP success rate at high stimulation frequency is significantly increased by linopirdine. Collectively, KCNQ2 channels play a significant role in regulating intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of motor nerve fibers of rats. These findings may provide insights into how the loss-of-function mutation in KCNQ2 channels can lead to neuromuscular disorders in human patients.","Node of Ranvier, Voltage-gated K+ channel, KCNQ2 channel, Kv7.2 channels, Action potential, Saltatory conduction, Motor nerves",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00949-0,2022

The cumulative injury effect triggers long-lasting pathological and molecular changes that may increase risk of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. R-mTBI is also characterized by changes in the brain proteome, where the majority of molecules altered early post-TBI are different from those altered at more chronic phases. This differentiation may contribute to the heterogeneity of available data on potential therapeutic targets and may present an obstacle in developing effective treatments. Here, we aimed to characterize a proteome profile of r-mTBI in a mouse model at two time points – 3 and 24 weeks post last TBI, as this may be a more relevant therapeutic window for individuals suffering negative consequences of r-mTBI. We identified a great number of proteins and phosphoproteins that remain continuously dysregulated from 3 to 24 weeks. These proteins may serve as effective therapeutic targets for sub-acute and chronic stages of post r-mTBI. We also compared canonical pathway activation associated with either total proteins or phosphoproteins and revealed that they both are upregulated at 24 weeks. However, at 3 weeks post-TBI, only pathways associated with total proteins are upregulated, while pathways driven by phosphoproteins are downregulated. Finally, to assess the translatability of our data, we compared proteomic changes in our mouse model with those reported in autopsied human samples of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) patients compared to controls. We observed 39 common proteins that were upregulated in both species and 24 common pathways associated with these proteins.

The purpose of this study was to create a map of the tissue content of these proteins in different regions of the CNS. The concentrations of the investigated proteins were determined with ELISA in post mortem tissue homogenates from 17 selected anatomical regions in the CNS from ten deceased donors aged 24 to 50 years.

There was a substantial variation in the concentrations of GFAP, MBP, NFL, tau and UCHL1 between different CNS regions. Highly myelinated areas of the CNS had tenfold higher MBP concentration than cerebral cortex, whereas tau showed an inverse pattern. GFAP, NFL and tau displayed an anteroposterior gradient in cerebral white matter. The cerebellum had low concentrations of all the investigated proteins. In conclusion, the tissue concentrations of GFAP, MBP, NFL, tau and UCHL1 were determined throughout the CNS.

However, the occurrence of ferroptosis in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) pathogenesis is still unknown. In this study, we firstly detected increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron, which are indicators of ferroptosis, in the cerebrum of ECM mice. Some important regulators of ferroptosis, including upregulated expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) levels, were also confirmed in ECM mice. Consistently, neuron damage, which was detected in the cerebrum of ECM mice, was positively correlated with reduced GPX4 expression and furtherly rescued by administration of the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). In addition, primary neurons were damaged by activated CD8+ T cells, an effect that was also partially rescued by Fer-1 on amyloid precursor protein expression and mitochondrial membrane potential levels in vitro. Activated CD8+ T cells were also shown to infiltrate the cerebrum of ECM mice and upregulate TfR1 expression in primary neurons, which may be an important event for inducing ferroptosis in ECM. Altogether, we show that ferroptosis contributes to neuron damage in ECM pathogenesis, and activated CD8+ T cells may be important inducers of neuronal ferroptosis. Hence, targeting ferroptosis may be a promising adjuvant therapeutic strategy for neurological sequelae in patients with cerebral malaria.","ACSL4, CD8+ T cell, Cerebral malaria, Ferroptosis, GPX4, Neuron, TfR1",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00942-7,2022

PV INs receive excitatory inputs from CA3 Schaffer collaterals and local CA1 pyramidal cells, and they provide perisomatic inhibition. Schaffer collateral excitatory synapses onto PV INs express Hebbian and anti-Hebbian types of long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as elicit LTP of intrinsic excitability (LTPIE). LTPIE requires the activation of type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5) and is mediated by downregulation of potassium channels Kv1.1. It is sensitive to rapamycin and thus may involve activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). LTPIE facilitates PV INs recruitment in CA1 and maintains an excitatory-inhibitory balance. Impaired CA1 PV INs activity or LTP affects network oscillations and memory. However, whether LTPIE in PV INs plays a role in hippocampus-dependent memory remains unknown. Here, we used conditional deletion of the obligatory component of mTORC1, the Regulatory-Associated Protein of mTOR (Raptor), to directly manipulate mTORC1 in PV INs. We found that homozygous, but not heterozygous, conditional knock-out of Rptor resulted in a decrease in CA1 PV INs of mTORC1 signaling via its downstream effector S6 phosphorylation assessed by immunofluorescence. In whole-cell recordings from hippocampal slices, repetitive firing of CA1 PV INs was impaired in mice with either homozygous or heterozygous conditional knock-out of Rptor. High frequency stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs that induce LTPIE in PV INs of control mice failed to do so in mice with either heterozygous or homozygous conditional knock-out of Rptor in PV INs. At the behavioral level, mice with homozygous or heterozygous conditional knock-out of Rptor showed similar long-term contextual fear memory or contextual fear memory discrimination relative to control mice. Thus, mTORC1 activity in CA1 PV INs regulates repetitive firing and LTPIE but not consolidation of long-term contextual fear memory and context discrimination. Our results indicate that mTORC1 plays cell-specific roles in synaptic plasticity of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons that are differentially involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.","GABA interneurons, Raptor conditional knock-out mice, Whole-cell recordings, CA1 hippocampus, Contextual fear conditioning",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00941-8,2022

Although control of mRNA translation plays an essential role in mammalian gene expression, how it contributes temporarily to the modulation of later stages of neuronal differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how translation control affects pathways and processes essential for neuronal maturation, using H9-derived human neuro progenitor cells differentiated into neurons as a model. Through Ribosome Profiling (Riboseq) combined with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis, we found that translation control regulates the expression of critical hub genes. Fundamental synaptic vesicle secretion genes belonging to SNARE complex, Rab family members, and vesicle acidification ATPases are strongly translationally regulated in developing neurons. Translational control also participates in neuronal metabolism modulation, particularly affecting genes involved in the TCA cycle and glutamate synthesis/catabolism. Importantly, we found translation regulation of several critical genes with fundamental roles regulating actin and microtubule cytoskeleton pathways, critical to neurite generation, spine formation, axon guidance, and circuit formation.

Object recognition memory (ORM) allows animals to identify familiar items and is essential for remembering facts and events. In rodents, long-term ORM formation requires a functional hippocampus but the involvement of the MS in this process remains controversial. We found that training adult male Wistar rats in a long-term ORM-inducing learning task involving exposure to two different, but behaviorally equivalent novel stimuli objects increased hippocampal theta power, and that suppressing theta via optogenetic MS inactivation caused amnesia. Importantly, the amnesia was specific to the object the animals were exploring when the MS was inactivated. Taken together, our results indicate that the MS is necessary for long-term ORM formation and suggest that hippocampal theta activity is causally linked to this process.","Theta rhythm, Amnesia, Hippocampus, Brain oscillations, Long-term memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00938-3,2022

Considering the significance of BBB in maintaining homeostasis and the neural environment, we aim to provide an overview of significant aspects of BBB. Worldwide, the treatment of neurological diseases caused by BBB disruption has been a major challenge. BBB also restricts entry of neuro-therapeutic drugs and hinders treatment modalities. Hence, currently nanotechnology-based approaches are being explored on large scale as alternatives to conventional methodologies. It is necessary to investigate the in-depth characteristic features of BBB to facilitate the discovery of novel drugs that can successfully cross the barrier and target the disease effectively. It is imperative to discover novel strategies to treat life-threatening CNS diseases in humans. Therefore, insights regarding building blocks of BBB, activation of immune response on breach of this barrier, and various autoimmune neurological disorders caused due to BBB dysfunction are discussed. Further, special emphasis is given on delineating BBB disruption leading to CNS disorders.

Therefore, we aimed to gain insight into the molecular signatures of the Hb in association with suicide in individuals with major depression. Postmortem gene expression analysis identified 251 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Hb tissue of suicides in comparison with Hb tissues from neurotypical individuals. Subsequent bioinformatic analyses using single-cell transcriptome data from the mouse Hb showed that the levels of a subset of endothelial cell-enriched genes encoding cell–cell junctional complex and plasma membrane-associated proteins, as well as the levels of their putative upstream transcriptional regulators, were significantly affected in suicides.

However, the neural populations involved in self-grooming remain largely unknown. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) has been implicated in the regulation of self-grooming. Arginine vasopressin-producing neurons are among the major neuronal populations in the PVH (PVHAVP), which play important roles in water homeostasis, blood pressure regulation, feeding, and stress response. Here, we report the critical role of PVHAVP neurons in the induction of self-grooming. Optogenetic activation of PVHAVP neurons immediately induced self-grooming in freely moving mice. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons also increased time spent self-grooming. In contrast, their chemogenetic inhibition significantly reduced naturally occurring self-grooming, suggesting that PVHAVP-induced grooming has physiological relevance. Notably, optogenetic activation of PVHAVP neurons triggered self-grooming over other adaptive behaviors, such as voracious feeding induced by fasting and social interaction with female mice. Thus, our study proposes the novel role of PVHAVP neurons in regulating self-grooming behavior and, consequently, hygiene maintenance and stress response. Furthermore, uncontrolled activation of these neurons may be potentially relevant to diseases characterized by compulsive behaviors and impaired social interaction, such as autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and anorexia nervosa.","Self-grooming, Vasopressin, Paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, Channelrhodopsin, DREADDs, Repetitive behavior",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00932-9,2022

So far, the anatomical localization of these proteins in the rodent and human brain have been reported, but co-expression of SV2 genes on a cellular level, their expressions in the human brain, comparison to radioligand binding, any possible regulation in epilepsy are not known. We have here analyzed the expression of SV2 genes in neuronal subtypes in the temporal neocortex in selected specimens by using single nucleus-RNA sequencing, and performed quantitative PCR in populations of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and healthy controls. [3H]-UCB-J autoradiography was performed to analyze the correlation between the mRNA transcript and binding capacity to SV2A. Our data showed that the SV2A transcript is expressed in all glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical subtypes, while SV2B expression is restricted to only the glutamatergic neurons and SV2C has very limited expression in a small subgroup of GABAergic interneurons. The level of [3H]-UCB-J binding and the concentration of SV2A mRNA is strongly correlated in each patient, and the expression is lower in the TLE patients. There is no relationship between SV2A expression and age, sex, seizure frequency, duration of epilepsy, or whether patients were recently treated with levetiracetam or not.

We focused on oxytocin (OXT) and its related receptors, because OXT plays a local role in DRG neurons. We measured the mRNA levels of OXT, OXT receptor (OXTR), vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), and piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (Piezo2) in single DRG neurons by using real-time PCR, and then performed a cluster analysis. According to the gene expression patterns, DRG neurons were classified into 4 clusters: Cluster 1 was characterized mainly by Piezo2, Cluster 2 by TRPV1, Cluster 4 by OXTR, and neurons in Cluster 3 did not express any of the target genes. The cell body diameter of OXT-expressing neurons was significantly larger in Cluster 1 than in Cluster 2. These results suggest that OXT-expressing DRG neurons with small cell bodies (Cluster 2) and large cell bodies (Cluster 1) probably correspond to C-fiber neurons and Aβ-fiber neurons, respectively. Furthermore, the OXT-expressing neurons contained not only TRPV1 but also Piezo2, suggesting that OXT may be released by mechanical stimulation regardless of nociception.

Here, we have investigated the impact of CaVβ1b and CaVβ2a subunits on plasma membrane trafficking of CaV1.2 using a live-labeling strategy.

Oral administration of KDS2010 effectively relieved PTX-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. KDS2010 (25 mg/Kg) significantly prevented and suppressed PTX-induced pain responses with minimal effects on the body weight, motor activity, and working memory. KDS2010 significantly reduced reactive astrocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the L4–L6 spinal cord of PTX-treated mice. Furthermore, KDS2010 reversed the attenuation of GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency in spinal dorsal horn neurons, although it failed to restore the reduced tonic GABAA inhibition nor the increased GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) expression in PTX-treated mice. In addition, bath application of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger (PBN) restored the sIPSC frequency in PTX-treated mice but not in control and PTX + KDS2010-treated mice. These results indicated that the antiallodynic effect of KDS2010 is not due to a MAO-B-dependent GABA production. Finally, PBN alone also exerted a similar analgesic effect as KDS2010, but a co-treatment of PBN with KDS2010 showed no additive effect, suggesting that inhibition of MAO-B-dependent ROS production is responsible for the analgesic effect by KDS2010 on PTX-induced allodynia. Overall, KDS2010 attenuated PTX-induced pain behaviors by restoring the altered ROS level and GABAergic inhibitory signaling in the spinal cord, suggesting that KDS2010 is a promising therapeutic strategy for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.","KDS2010, MAO-B, Tactile Hypersensitivity, Paclitaxel",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00924-9,2022

In comparison, rodent studies also show age-related decline but a greater degree of proliferation of new neurons in adult animals. These differences may represent biological species differences or could alternatively be explained by methodological differences in tissue handling and fixation. Here, we examine whether differences in the post-mortem interval between death and tissue fixation might impact subsequent detection of adult neurogenesis due to increased tissue degradation. Because there are fewer new neurons present in older subjects to begin with we hypothesized that, subject age might interact significantly with post-mortem interval in the detection of adult neurogenesis. We analyzed neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats that were either perfusion-fixed or the brains extracted and immersion-fixed at various post-mortem intervals. We observed an interaction between animal age and the time delay between death and tissue fixation. While similar levels of neurogenesis were observed in young rats regardless of fixation, older rats had significantly fewer labeled neurons when fixation was not immediate.

Consequently, we aimed to investigate the potential role of Rufy3 in an in vivo model of SAH-induced early brain injury (EBI). In addition, we investigated the relevant brain-protective mechanisms. Oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) stimulation of cultured primary neurons simulated vitro SAH condition. The SAH rat model was induced by infusing autologous blood into the optic chiasma pool and treating the rats with lentivirus-negative control 1 (LV-NC1), lentivirus-Rufy3 shRNA (LV-shRNA), lentivirus-negative control 2 (LV-NC2), lentivirus-Rufy3 (LV-Rufy3), or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (8p-CPT) (Rap1 agonist). In experiment one, we found that the protein level of Rufy3 decreased and neuronal axon injury in the injured neurons but was rectified by LV-Rufy3 treatment. In experiment two, mRNA and protein levels of Rufy3 were downregulated in brain tissue and reached the lowest level at 24 h after SAH. In addition, the expression of Myelin Basic Protein was downregulated and that of anti-hypophosphorylated neurofilament H (N52) was upregulated after SAH. In experiments three and four, Rufy3 overexpression (LV-Rufy3) increased the interactions between Rufy3 and Rap1, the level of Rap1-GTP, and the ratio of Rap1-GTP/total GTP. In addition, LV-Rufy3 treatment inhibited axon injury and accelerated axon repair by activating the Rap1/Arap3/Rho/Fascin signaling pathway accompanied by upregulated protein expression levels of ARAP3, Rho, Fascin, and Facin. LV-Rufy3 also enhanced synaptic plasticity by activating the Rap1/MEK/ERK/synapsin I signaling pathway accompanied by upregulated protein expression levels of ERK1, p-ERK1, MEK1, p-MEK1, synaspin I, and p-synaspin I. Moreover, LV-Rufy3 also alleviated brain damage indicators, including cortical neuronal cell apoptosis and degeneration, brain edema, and cognitive impairment after SAH. However, the downregulation of Rufy3 had the opposite effect and aggravated EBI induced by SAH.

This is concerning as exposure to anesthesia has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the causal relationship between clinical AD development and anesthesia remains conjectural. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that anesthesia, such as halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane, induces AD-like pathophysiological changes and cognitive impairments in transgenic mouse models of AD. Desflurane does not have these effects and is expected to have more potential for use in elderly patients, yet little is known about its effects, especially on non-cognitive functions, such as motor and emotional functions. Thus, we examined the postanesthetic effects of desflurane and sevoflurane on motor and emotional function in aged AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F (App-KI) mice. This is a recently developed transgenic mouse model of AD exhibiting amyloid β peptide (Aβ) amyloidosis and a neuroinflammatory response in an age-dependent manner without non-physiological amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression. Mice were subjected to a short behavioral test battery consisting of an elevated plus maze, a balance beam test, and a tail suspension test seven days after exposure to 8.0% desflurane for 6 h or 2.8% sevoflurane for 2 h. App-KI mice showed significant increments in the percentage of entry and time spent in open arms in the elevated plus maze, increments in the number of slips and latency to traverse for the balance beam test, increments in the limb clasping score, increments in immobile duration, and decrements in latency to first immobile episode for the tail suspension test compared to age-matched wild type (WT) controls. Desflurane- and sevoflurane-exposed App-KI mice showed a delayed decrement in the number of slips for each trial in the balance beam test, while air-treated App-KI mice rapidly improved their performance, and increased their clasping behavior in the tail suspension test. Furthermore, App-KI inhibited the change in membrane GluA3 following exposure to anesthetics in the cerebellum. These results suggest high validity of App-KI mice as an animal model of AD.","Alzheimer’s disease, Transgenic mice, General anesthesia, Postanesthetic effects, Behavioral phenotype, AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00910-1,2022

CSB inhibited the fibrillation of α-synuclein in a concentration-dependent manner through direct binding to the N-terminus of α-synuclein. Furthermore, both seeded polymerization and cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein were inhibited by CSB treatment. Notably, CSB alleviated behavioral deficits and neuropathological features, such as phospho-α-synuclein and astrogliosis, in A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice.

The 3q29 microdeletion (3q29del), a recurrent copy number variant, confers a high risk for ASD and schizophrenia, and serves as an important pathological model for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of a large number of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Recently, mouse models carrying a deletion of the chromosomal region corresponding to the human 3q29 region (Df/+ mice) were generated and demonstrated neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions associated behavioral abnormalities, pointing to the relevance of Df/+ mice as a model for these conditions with high construct and face validity. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis of these behavioral phenotypes in Df/+ mice remains unclear. The oxytocin (OXT) system plays a central role in social behavior across species and has a potential role in ASD. In this study, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind impaired social behavior in Df/+ mice, we investigated the possible involvement of OXT signaling in impaired social behavior in Df/+ mice. We demonstrated that OXT administration restored the impaired social behavior in Df/+ mice. We also demonstrated that the number of OXT-positive cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was significantly lower in Df/+ mice than in wild-type (WT) littermates.

This includes elements from multiple different families and subfamilies of retrotransposons, however there is limited knowledge of the specific loci from which this expression occurs in ALS. The long interspersed element-1 (L1) is the only autonomous retrotransposon in the human genome and members of this family of elements maintain the ability to mobilise. Despite L1s contributing to 17% of the human genome only 80–100 L1s encode the required proteins for mobilisation and are retrotransposition competent. Identifying the specific loci from which L1 expression occurs will inform on the potential functional consequences of their expression, such as the potential for somatic retrotransposition or DNA damage caused by the endonuclease activity of the ORF2 protein of the L1. Here we characterised L1 loci expression using the L1EM tool (https://github.com/FenyoLab/L1EM) in RNA sequencing data from 518 samples across four tissues (motor cortex, frontal cortex, cerebellum and cervical spinal cord) in the Target ALS cohort obtained from the New York Genome Center. There was a significant reduction in total intact L1 expression (those that encode functional proteins) in two brain regions of individuals with ALS compared to controls and clustering of the ALS brain regions occurred based on their intact L1 expression profile. Although overall the levels of L1 expression were reduced in ALS/ALS with other neurological disorder (ND) there were individuals in which L1s were expressed at much higher levels than the rest of the ALS/ALSND cohort. Expressed L1 loci were more frequently located in introns compared to those not expressed and the level of L1 expression positively correlated with the expression of the gene in which it was located. Significant differences were observed in the expression profiles of L1s in ALS and specific features of these elements, such as location in the genome and whether or not they are intact, were significantly associated with those that were expressed in the cohort.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1/L1), Retrotransposon, Expression",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00914-x,2022

One approach to exploit these interactions therapeutically is to target the pathways that regulate metabolism. In this respect, the nutrient-sensing hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is of particular interest since it introduces a protein post-translational modification known as O-GlcNAcylation, which modifies different proteins in control versus neurodegenerative disease postmortem brains. A potent inhibitor of the O-GlcNAcase enzyme that removes the modification from proteins, Thiamet G (TG), has been proposed to have potential benefits in Alzheimer’s disease. We tested whether key factors in the O-GlcNAcylation are correlated with mitochondrial electron transport and proteins related to the autophagy/lysosomal pathways in the cortex of male and female mice with and without exposure to TG (10 mg/kg i.p.). Mitochondrial complex activities were measured in the protein homogenates, and a panel of metabolic, autophagy/lysosomal proteins and O-GlcNAcylation enzymes were assessed by either enzyme activity assay or by western blot analysis.

The current hypothesis predicts simultaneous excitation of cataplexy-inhibiting orexin neurons and cataplexy-inducing amygdala neurons. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activity of putative orexin neurons in orexin-knockout mice during cataplexy episodes using fiber photometry. We created two animal models of orexin-knockout mice with a GCaMP6 fluorescent indicator expressed in putative orexin neurons. We first prepared orexin-knockout mice crossed with transgenic mice carrying a tetracycline-controlled transactivator transgene under the control of the orexin promoter. TetO-GCaMP6 was then introduced into mice via an adeno-associated virus injection or natural crossing. The resulting two models showed restricted expression of GCaMP6 in the hypothalamus, where orexin neurons should be located, and showed excitation to an intruder stress that was similar to that observed in orexin-intact mice in our previous study. The activity of these putative orexin neurons increased immediately before the onset of cataplexy-like behavior but decreased (approximately − 20% of the baseline) during the cataplexy-like episode. We propose that the activity of orexin neurons during cataplexy is moderately inhibited by an unknown mechanism. The absence of cataplexy in wild-type mice may be explained by basal or residual activity-induced orexin release, and emotional stimulus-induced counter activation of orexin neurons may not be necessary. This study will serve as a basis for better treatment of cataplexy in narcolepsy patients.","Cataplexy, Narcolepsy, Fiber photometry, Orexin knockout mice, Positive emotion",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00907-w,2022

The Glu/GABA ratio, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/total creatine (tCr) ratio, and tCr level in the prefrontal cortex were significantly different in Cntnap2−/− mice compared to those in wild-type mice, and they significantly correlated with the sociability of mice. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses indicated high specificity and selectivity of these metabolites in discriminating genotypes. These results suggest that the lowered Glu/GABA ratio in the prefrontal cortex along with the changes in the other metabolites might contribute to the social behavior deficit in Cntnap2−/− mice. Our results also demonstrate the utility of 1H-MRS in investigating the underlying mechanisms or the diagnosis of ASD.","Autism spectrum disorder, E/I balance, Glu/GABA, Creatine, Sociability, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00904-z,2022

The extracellular/luminal moiety of SorLA has a unique mosaic domain composition and interacts with a large number of different and partially unrelated ligands, including the amyloid precursor protein as well as amyloid-β. Several studies support a strong association of SorLA with sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although SorLA seems to be an important factor in AD, the large number of different ligands suggests a role as a neuronal multifunctional receptor with additional intracellular sorting capacities. Therefore, understanding the determinants of SorLA’s subcellular targeting might be pertinent for understanding neuronal endosomal sorting mechanisms in general. A number of cytosolic adaptor proteins have already been demonstrated to determine intracellular trafficking of SorLA. Most of these adaptors and several ligands of the extracellular/luminal moiety are shared with the Vps10p-D receptor Sortilin. Although SorLA and Sortilin show both a predominant intracellular and endosomal localization, they are targeted to different endosomal compartments. Thus, independent adaptor proteins may convey their differential endosomal targeting. Here, we hypothesized that Sortilin and SorLA interact with the cytosolic adaptors PSD95 and PICK1 which have been shown to bind the Vps10p-D receptor SorCS3. We observed only an interaction for SorLA and PICK1 in mammalian-two-hybrid, pull-down and cellular recruitment experiments. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the C-terminal minimal PDZ domain binding motif VIA of SorLA mediates the interaction. Moreover, we show co-localization of SorLA and PICK1 at vesicular structures in primary neurons. Although the physiological role of the interaction between PICK1 and SorLA remains unsolved, our study suggests that PICK1 partakes in regulating SorLA’s intracellular itinerary.","SorLA, Sorting receptor, Vps10p-domain, PICK1, PDZ-domain, Protein interaction, Neuronal endosomal sorting and trafficking",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00903-0,2022

As in the stimulation of Gs-coupled dopamine D1-receptors or Gi-coupled D2-receptors by endogenous dopamine, we investigated whether specific stimulation of dopamine D1-receptor-expressing neurons or inhibition of dopamine D2-receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens could produce anti-tumor effects and improve the immune system in transgenic mice using pharmacogenetic techniques. Repeated stimulation of D1-receptor-expressing neurons in either the medial shell, lateral shell or core regions of the nucleus accumbens significantly decreased tumor volume under a state of tumor transplantation, whereas repeated suppression of D2-receptor-expressing neurons in these areas had no effect on this event. The number of splenic CD8+ T cells was significantly increased following repeated stimulation of D1-receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens of mice with tumor transplantation. Furthermore, this stimulation produced a significant reduction in the population of splenic CD8+ T cells that expressed immune checkpoint-related inhibitory receptors, PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is widely used to study brain function. Here, we present a natural marmoset model of generalized epilepsy. In this unique marmoset family, generalized epilepsy was successfully induced by handling operations in some individuals. We mapped the marmoset family with handling-sensitive epilepsy and found that the epileptic phenotype can be inherited. These marmosets were more sensitive to the epilepsy inducers pentylenetetrazol. Using electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings, we detected epileptiform discharge in marmosets with a history of seizures. In summary, we report a family of marmosets with generalized seizures induced by handling operations.

The rapid advancement of massively parallel sequencing has resulted in the identification of more than 40 new mutations in COQ8A and functional studies are required to confirm causality and to further research into determining the specific mechanisms through which the mutations result in loss of function. To that end, a Drosophila model of Coq8 deficiency was developed and characterized to determine its appropriateness as a model system to further explore the role of Coq8 in the brain, and for functional characterisation of Coq8 mutations. Pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of Coq8 was largely lethal, with female escapers displaying severe locomotor deficits. Knockdown of Coq8 in the eye resulted in degeneration of photoreceptors, progressive necrosis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Reintroduction of wild-type Coq8 restored normal function, however expression of human wild-type COQ8A exacerbated the eye phenotype, suggesting it was acting as a dominant-negative. This model is therefore informative for investigating the function of Drosophila Coq8, however human COQ8A mutations cannot be assessed as hCOQ8A does not rescue Coq8 deficiency.","coq8, COQ8A, Coenzyme Q10, Brain, Neuron, Drosophila, Neurodevelopment, Neurodegeneration, Photoreceptor, Mitochondria",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00900-3,2022

Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosome-dependent process in which eukaryotic cells removal misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in cytoplasm, which is critical for energy metabolism, organelle renewal, and maintenance of intracellular homeostasis. Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays important roles in pathophysiological mechanisms under ischemic conditions. However, there are still controversies about whether autophagy plays a neuroprotective or damaging role after ischemia. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), one of the largest protein receptor superfamilies in mammals, play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. Statistics show that GPCRs are the targets of about one-fifth of drugs known in the world, predicting potential values as targets for drug research. Studies have demonstrated that nutritional deprivation can directly or indirectly activate GPCRs, mediating a series of downstream biological processes, including autophagy. It can be concluded that there are interactions between autophagy and GPCRs signaling pathway, which provides research evidence for regulating GPCRs-mediated autophagy. This review aims to systematically discuss the underlying mechanism and dual roles of autophagy in cerebral ischemia, and describe the GPCRs-mediated autophagy, hoping to probe promising therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke through in-depth exploration of the GPCRs-mediated autophagy signaling pathway.","Ischemic stroke, Autophagy, Macroautophagy, G-protein-coupled receptors, Neuropharmacology",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-022-00899-7,2022

Unfortunately, identifying the pericytes from among such hPSC-derived mural cells has been challenging. This is due both to the lack of pericyte-specific markers and to the loss of defining anatomical information inherent to culture conditions. We therefore asked whether NeuroTrace 500/525, a newly developed dye that shows cell-specific uptake into pericytes in the mouse brain, can help identify human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived brain pericyte-like cells. First, we found that NeuroTrace 500/525 specifically stains primary cultured human brain pericytes, confirming its specificity in vitro. Second, we found that NeuroTrace 500/525 specifically labels hiPSC-derived pericyte-like cells, but not endothelial cells or vSMCs derived from the same hiPSCs. Last, we found that neuroectoderm-derived vSMCs, which have pericyte-like features, also take up NeuroTrace 500/525.

Finally, we show that SCAMP2-mediated knockdown of the T-type conductance is caused by the lack of Cav3.2 expression at the cell surface as evidenced by the concomitant loss of intramembrane charge movement without decrease of total Cav3.2 protein level. Taken together, our results indicate that SCAMP2 plays an important role in the trafficking of Cav3.2 channels at the plasma membrane.","Ion channels, Calcium channels, T-type channels, Cav3.2 channels, Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 2, SCAMP2, Trafficking",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00891-7,2022

As adult hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease, we tested the hypothesis that sAPPα delivery would rescue adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. An adeno-associated virus-9 (AAV9) encoding murine sAPPα was injected into the hippocampus of 8-month-old wild-type and APP/PS1 mice, and later two different thymidine analogues (XdU) were systemically injected to label adult-born cells at different time points after viral transduction. The proliferation of adult-born cells, cell survival after eight weeks, and cell differentiation into either neurons or astrocytes was studied. Proliferation was impaired in APP/PS1 mice but was restored to wild-type levels by viral expression of sAPPα. In contrast, sAPPα overexpression failed to rescue the survival of XdU+-labelled cells that was impaired in APP/PS1 mice, although it did cause a significant increase in the area density of astrocytes in the granule cell layer across both genotypes. Finally, viral expression of sAPPα reduced amyloid-beta plaque load in APP/PS1 mice in the dentate gyrus and somatosensory cortex. These data add further evidence that increased levels of sAPPα could be therapeutic for the cognitive decline in AD, in part through restoration of the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in adults.","Alzheimer’s disease, Adult neurogenesis, sAPPα, Dentate gyrus, APP/PS1, Astrocytes, Proliferation, Differentiation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00889-1,2022

It penetrates the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, which are vital events leading to the development of meningitis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in regulating neuroinflammatory signaling, and our previous study showed that E. coli can induce differential expression of lncRNAs, including lncC11orf54-1, in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). The hBMECs constitute the structural and functional basis for the BBB, however, it is unclear whether lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses of hBMECs during meningitic E. coli infection. In this study, we characterized an abundantly expressed lncRNA, lncC11orf54-1, which was degraded by translocated coilin to produce mgU2-19 and mgU2-30 in hBMECs during E. coli infection. Functionally, lncC11orf54-1-originated non-coding RNA mgU2-30 interacted with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to induce its oligomerization and autophosphorylation, thus promoting the activation of NF-κB signaling and facilitating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In summary, our study uncovers the involvement of lncC11orf54-1 in IRAK1–NF-κB signaling, and it functions as a positive regulator of inflammatory responses in meningitic E. coli-induced neuroinflammation, which may be a valuable therapeutic and diagnostic target for bacterial meningitis.","LncC11orf54-1, Neuroinflammation, Brain microvascular endothelial cells, NF-κB signaling, Meningitic Escherichia coli, Blood–brain barrier",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00890-8,2022

It is mostly diagnosed only after symptoms develop, at which point very few treatment options are available. Therefore, patients who have an increased risk of developing brain metastasis need to be identified early. Our study aimed to identify genomic and epigenomic biomarkers for predicting brain metastasis risk in NSCLC patients.MethodsPaired primary lung tumor tissues and either brain metastatic tissues or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 29 patients with treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC with central nervous system (CNS) metastases. A control group comprising 31 patients with advanced NSCLC who died without ever developing CNS metastasis was also included. Somatic mutations and DNA methylation levels were examined through capture-based targeted sequencing with a 520-gene panel and targeted bisulfite sequencing with an 80,672 CpG panel.ResultsCompared to primary lung lesions, brain metastatic tissues harbored numerous unique copy number variations. The tumor mutational burden was comparable between brain metastatic tissue (P = 0.168)/CSF (P = 0.445) and their paired primary lung tumor samples. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP1) mutations were detected in primary lung tumor and brain metastatic tissue samples of patients with brain metastasis. KEAP1 mutation rate was significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than those without (P = 0.031). DNA methylation analysis revealed 15 differentially methylated blocks between primary lung tumors of patients with and without CNS metastasis. A brain metastasis risk prediction model based on these 15 differentially methylated blocks had an area under the curve of 0.94, with 87.1% sensitivity and 82.8% specificity.ConclusionsOur analyses revealed 15 differentially methylated blocks in primary lung tumor tissues, which can differentiate patients with and without CNS metastasis. These differentially methylated blocks may serve as predictive biomarkers for the risk of developing CNS metastasis in NSCLC. Additional larger studies are needed to validate the predictive value of these markers.","Brain metastases, Predictive biomarker, DNA methylation, Somatic mutation, Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (advanced NSCLC)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00886-4,2021

Previous studies demonstrated that the infralimbic cortex (IL) is essential for extinction of learned fear, while neural activity in the prelimbic cortex (PL) facilitates fear responding and is negatively correlated with the strength of extinction memories. Though these adjacent regions in the prefrontal cortex maintain mutual synaptic connectivity, it has been unclear whether PL and IL interact functionally with each other during fear extinction learning. Here we addressed this question by recording local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from PL and IL of awake behaving rats during extinction of auditory fear memories. We found that LFP power in the fast gamma frequency (100–200 Hz) in both PL and IL regions increased during extinction learning. In addition, coherency analysis showed that synchronization between PL and IL in the fast gamma frequency was enhanced over the course of extinction. These findings support the hypothesis that interregional interactions between PL and IL increase as animals extinguish aversive memories.","Fear extinction, Medial prefrontal cortex, Electrophysiology, Oscillation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00884-6,2021

Despite their physiological importance, untangling the relationship between DA and NE in the fine control of output function is currently challenging, primarily due to a lack of techniques to allow the observation of spatiotemporal dynamics with sufficiently high selectivity. Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed ‘R-GenGAR-DA’. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was replaced by the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple. We developed two variants: R-GenGAR-DA1.1, which brightened following DA stimulation, and R-GenGAR-DA1.2, which dimmed. R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated a reasonable dynamic range (ΔF/F0 = − 43%), DA affinity (EC50 = 0.92 µM) and high selectivity for DA over NE (66-fold) in HeLa cells. Taking advantage of the high selectivity of R-GenGAR-DA1.2, we monitored DA in presence of NE using dual-color fluorescence live imaging, combined with the green-NE biosensor GRABNE1m, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (> 350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture. Thus, this is a first step toward the multiplex imaging of these neurotransmitters in, for example, freely moving animals, which will provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of the high spatiotemporal dynamics of DA and NE in normal and abnormal brain function.","GPCR, Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Fluorescence probe, Hippocampal neuron",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00882-8,2021

Spatial memory, the ability to remember the layout of the external environment and to navigate within its boundaries, is closely related to the autobiographical memory domain. It is served by an overlapping brain circuit, centered around the hippocampus (HPC) where the cognitive map index is stored. Apart from the hippocampus, several cortical structures participate in this process. Their relative contribution is a subject of intense research in both humans and animal models. One of the most widely studied regions is the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), an area in the parietal lobe densely interconnected with the hippocampal formation. Several methodological approaches have been established over decades in order to investigate the cortical aspects of memory. One of the most successful techniques is based on the analysis of brain expression patterns of the immediate early genes (IEGs). The common feature of this diverse group of genes is fast upregulation of their mRNA translation upon physiologically relevant stimulus. In the central nervous system they are rapidly triggered by neuronal activity and plasticity during learning. There is a widely accepted consensus that their expression level corresponds to the engagement of individual neurons in the formation of memory trace. Imaging of the IEGs might therefore provide a picture of an emerging memory engram. In this review we present the overview of IEG mapping studies of retrosplenial cortex in rodent models. We begin with classical techniques, immunohistochemical detection of protein and fluorescent in situ hybridization of mRNA. We then proceed to advanced methods where fluorescent genetically encoded IEG reporters are chronically followed in vivo during memory formation. We end with a combination of genetic IEG labelling and optogenetic approach, where the activity of the entire engram is manipulated. We finally present a hypothesis that attempts to unify our current state of knowledge about the function of RSC.","Immediate early genes, c-Fos, Arc, Homer, Retrosplenial cortex, Spatial memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00880-w,2021

Justin Lee,cjl@ibs.re.kr,2021-11-27,"Light is a powerful external cue modulating the biological rhythm of internal clock neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). GABA signaling in SCN is critically involved in this process. Both phasic and tonic modes of GABA signaling exist in SCN. Of the two modes, the tonic mode of GABA signaling has been implicated in light-mediated synchrony of SCN neurons. However, modulatory effects of external light on tonic GABA signalling are yet to be explored. Here, we systematically characterized electrophysiological properties of the clock neurons and determined the spatio-temporal profiles of tonic GABA current. Based on the whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from 76 SCN neurons, the cells with large tonic GABA current (>15 pA) were more frequently found in dorsal SCN. Moreover, tonic GABA current in SCN was highly correlated with the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC), raising a possibility that tonic GABA current is due to spill-over from synaptic release. Interestingly, tonic GABA current was inversely correlated with slice-to-patch time interval, suggesting a critical role of retinal light exposure in intact brain for an induction of tonic GABA current in SCN. To test this possibility, we obtained meticulously prepared retina-attached SCN slices and successfully recorded tonic and phasic GABA signaling in SCN neurons. For the first time, we observed an early-onset, long-lasting tonic GABA current, followed by a slow-onset, short-lasting increase in the phasic GABA frequency, upon direct light-illumination of the attached retina. This result provides the first evidence that external light cue can directly trigger both tonic and phasic GABA signaling in SCN cell. In conclusion, we propose tonic GABA as the key mediator of external light in SCN.","Whole-cell patch, Spatiotemporal analysis, Retina-attached SCN, Light triggered tonic GABA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00881-9,2021

Mice expressing Cre recombinase in forebrain excitatory neurons (CaMKII-Cre) were crossed with ROCK2fl/fl mice (Cre/ROCK2fl/fl), and the contribution of ROCK2 in behavior as well as dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA) was examined. Cre/ROCK2fl/fl mice spent reduced time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and increased time in the dark of the light–dark box test compared to littermate controls.

Beyond the brainstem, it is unclear if RBD patients comorbid with PD have more affected striatal dopamine denervation compared to PD patients unaffected by RBD (PD-RBD−). To elucidate this, we evaluated the availability of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), an index of nigrostriatal dopamine innervation, in 15 PD patients with probable RBD (PD-RBD+), 15 PD-RBD−, and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using [11C]DTBZ PET imaging. This technique measured VMAT2 availability within striatal regions of interest (ROI). A mixed effect model was used to compare the radioligand binding of VMAT2 between the three groups for each striatal ROI, while co-varying for sex, cognitive function and depression scores. Multiple regressions were also computed to predict clinical measures from group condition and VMAT2 binding within all ROIs explored. We observed a significant main effect of group condition on VMAT2 availability within the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamus. Specifically, our results revealed that PD-RBD+ had lower VMAT2 availability compared to HC in all these regions except for the subthalamus and substantia nigra, while PD-RBD− was significantly lower than HC in all these regions. PD-RBD− showed a negative relationship between motor severity and VMAT2 availability within the left caudate. Our findings reflect that both PD patient subgroups had similar denervation within the nigrostriatal pathway. There were no significant interactions detected between radioligand binding and clinical scores in PD-RBD+. Taken together, VMAT2 and striatal dopamine denervation in general may not be a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of RBD in PD patients.

Here, to uncover the specific functions of Olig2-astrocytes, we first analyzed public single-cell RNA-seq databases of adult mouse brains. Unbiased classification of gene expression profiles and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that the majority of Olig2-astrocytes belonged to an astrocytic cluster that is enriched for transporter-related genes. SLC7A10 (also known as ASC-1) was one of the representative neutral amino acid transporter genes in the cluster. To complement the in silico data analyses, we differentially isolated Olig2- and GFAP-astrocytes from the same frozen section of the lateral globus pallidus using laser microdissection and compared their gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We confirmed that Olig2 and GFAP mRNAs were preferentially expressed in the Olig2- and GFAP-astrocytes, respectively, indicating that the laser microdissection method yielded minimal cross-contamination between two types of cells. The Olig2-astrocytes expressed significantly higher levels of SLC7A10 mRNA than the GFAP-astrocytes, corroborating the in silico data. We next localized SLC7A10 protein by immunohistochemistry in the lateral globus pallidus, which was also genetically labeled for Olig2. SLC7A10 co-localized with Olig2-genetic labeling, especially on the fine processes of Olig2-astrocytes. These results are consistent with the recent discovery that SLC7A10 is expressed not only in neurons but also in a subset of astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that SLC7A10 exerts specific functions in Olig2-astrocytes of the adult brain.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00874-8,2021

However, the regulation and function of KIFs in the prelimbic cortex insofar as mediating memory consolidation is not known. We find that within one hour of contextual fear conditioning, the expression of KIF3B is upregulated in the prelimbic but not the infralimbic cortex. Importantly, lentiviral-mediated knockdown of KIF3B in the prelimbic cortex produces deficits in consolidation while reducing freezing behavior during extinction of contextual fear. We also find that the depletion of KIF3B increases spine density within prelimbic neurons.

Mechanical hypersensitivity of PD model induced by MPTP peaked at 3 days and persisted for at least 14 days.

E-LTP was not significantly affected in slices of MPTP treated animals. LTD induced by repetitive stimulation was not affected. Furthermore, we found that paired-pulse facilitation and spontaneous release of glutamate were also altered in MPTP treated animals, suggesting presynaptic enhancement of excitatory transmission in PD.

Different species of songbirds exhibit species-specific learning programs during song acquisition. Songbirds with open-ended vocal learning capacity, such as the canary, modify their songs during adulthood. Nevertheless, the neural molecular mechanisms underlying open-ended vocal learning are not fully understood. We investigated the singing-driven expression of neural activity-dependent genes (Arc, Egr1, c-fos, Nr4a1, Sik1, Dusp6, and Gadd45β) in the canary to examine a potential relationship between the gene expression level and the degree of seasonal vocal plasticity at different ages. The expression of these genes was differently regulated throughout the critical period of vocal learning in the zebra finch, a closed-ended song learner. In the canary, the neural activity-dependent genes were induced by singing in the song nuclei throughout the year. However, in the vocal motor nucleus, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), all genes were regulated with a higher induction rate by singing in the fall than in the spring. The singing-driven expression of these genes showed a similar induction rate in the fall between the first year juvenile and the second year adult canaries, suggesting a seasonal, not age-dependent, regulation of the neural activity-dependent genes. By measuring seasonal vocal plasticity and singing-driven gene expression, we found that in RA, the induction intensity of the neural activity-dependent genes was correlated with the state of vocal plasticity. These results demonstrate a correlation between vocal plasticity and the singing-driven expression of neural activity-dependent genes in RA through song development, regardless of whether a songbird species possesses an open- or closed-ended vocal learning capacity.","Song learning, Sensorimotor learning, Learning plasticity, Critical period, Arc, IEGs",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00869-5,2021

CNS immune status emerges by the integration of the responses of resident and not resident cells, leading to alterations in neural circuits functions. To explore spinal cord astrocyte reactivity to inflammatory threats we focused our study on the effects of local inflammation in a controlled micro-environment, the organotypic spinal slices, developed from the spinal cord of mouse embryos. These organ cultures represent a complex in vitro model where sensory-motor cytoarchitecture, synaptic properties and spinal cord resident cells, are retained in a 3D fashion and we recently exploit these cultures to model two diverse immune conditions in the CNS, involving different inflammatory networks and products. Here, we specifically focus on the tuning of calcium signaling in astrocytes by these diverse types of inflammation and we investigate the mechanisms which modulate intracellular calcium release and its spreading among astrocytes in the inflamed environment. Organotypic spinal cord slices are cultured for two or three weeks in vitro (WIV) and exposed for 6 h to a cocktail of cytokines (CKs), composed by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 β) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By live calcium imaging of the ventral horn, we document an increase in active astrocytes and in the occurrence of spontaneous calcium oscillations displayed by these cells when exposed to each inflammatory threat. Through several pharmacological treatments, we demonstrate that intracellular calcium sources and the activation of connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels have a pivotal role in increasing calcium intercellular communication in both CKs and LPS conditions, while the Cx43 gap junction communication is apparently reduced by the inflammatory treatments.","Pro-inflammatory cytokines, LPS, Live imaging, Neuroinflammation, Gap junctions, Hemichannels, Spinal neurons, Immune resident cells",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00868-6,2021

Despite biochemical evidence about the role of γ-secretase in the generation of APP, the molecular origin of how spatial heterogeneity in the generation of proteoforms arises is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the localization of Nicastrin, a γ-secretase subunit, at nanometer sized functional zones of the synapse. With the help of super resolution microscopy, we confirm that Nicastrin is organized into nanodomains of high molecular density within an excitatory synapse. A similar nanoorganization was also observed for APP and the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, Presenilin 1, that were discretely associated with Nicastrin nanodomains. Though Nicastrin is a functional subunit of γ-secretase, the Nicastrin and Presenilin1 nanodomains were either colocalized or localized independent of each other. The Nicastrin and Presenilin domains highlight a potential independent regulation of these molecules different from their canonical secretase function. The collisions between secretases and substrate molecules decide the probability and rate of product formation for transmembrane proteolysis. Our observations of secretase nanodomains indicate a spatial difference in the confinement of substrate and secretases, affecting the local probability of product formation by increasing their molecular availability, resulting in differential generation of proteoforms even within single synapses.","Nicastrin, Synapse, Alzheimer’s disease, Presenilin, APP, Super resolution microscopy, STED, Secretase",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00855-x,2021

In this study, we aim to investigate the direct impact of selective increase of GHS-R1a expression in dCA1 excitatory/inhibitory neurons on learning and memory.MethodsEndogenous GHS-R1a distribution in dCA1 excitatory/inhibitory neurons was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cre-dependent GHS-R1a overexpression in excitatory or inhibitory neurons was done by stereotaxic injection of aav-hSyn-DIO-hGhsr1a-2A-eGFP virus in dCA1 region of vGlut1-Cre or Dlx5/6-Cre mice respectively.

Selective increase of GHS-R1a expression in dCA1 pyramidal neurons impaired spatial memory and object-place recognition memory. In contrast, selective increase of GHS-R1a expression in dCA1 interneurons enhanced long-term memory performance. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a neuronal type-specific role that hippocampal GHS-R1a signaling plays in regulating memory.

We utilized no known disease/healthy COs (HC) as normal function controls. At 3–4 and 6–10 months post-differentiation, COs with mutations showed no evidence of disease-related pathology. Electrophysiology assessment showed that all COs exhibited mature neuronal firing at 6–10 months old. At this age, we observed significant changes in the electrophysiology of the COs with disease-associated mutations (dCOs) as compared with the HC, including reduced neuronal network communication, slowing neuronal oscillations, and increased coupling of delta and theta phases to the amplitudes of gamma oscillations. Such changes were linked with the detection of hypersynchronous events like spike-and-wave discharges. These dysfunctions were associated with altered production and release of neurotransmitters, compromised activity of excitatory ionotropic receptors including receptors of kainate, AMPA, and NMDA, and changed levels and function of excitatory glutamatergic synapses and inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Neuronal properties that modulate GABAergic inhibition including the activity of Na–K-Cl cotransport 1 (NKCC1) in Cl− homeostasis and the levels of synaptic and extra-synaptic localization of GABA receptors (GABARs) were altered in the T21 COs only.

Although it has been reported that synapses themselves change from an immature to a mature state as neurons mature, there are few reports that clearly show when and how human stem cell-derived neurons change to mature synaptic structures. This study was designed to elucidate the synapse formation process of hiPSC-neurons. We propagated hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiPSC-NPCs) that expressed localized markers of the ventral hindbrain as neurospheres by dual SMAD inhibition and then differentiated them into hiPSC-neurons in vitro. After 49 days of in vitro differentiation, hiPSC-neurons significantly expressed pre- and postsynaptic markers at both the transcript and protein levels. However, the expression of postsynaptic markers was lower than in normal human or normal rat brain tissues, and immunostaining analysis showed that it was relatively modest and was lower than that of presynaptic markers and that its localization in synaptic structures was insufficient. Neurophysiological analysis using a microelectrode array also revealed that no synaptic activity was generated on hiPSC-neurons at 49 days of differentiation. Analysis of subtype markers by immunostaining revealed that most hiPSC-neurons expressed vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2). The presence or absence of NGF, which is required for the survival of cholinergic neurons, had no effect on their cell fractionation. These results suggest that during the synaptogenesis of hiPSC-neurons, the formation of presynaptic structures is not the only requirement for the formation of postsynaptic structures and that the mRNA expression of postsynaptic markers does not correlate with the formation of their mature structures. Technically, we also confirmed a certain level of robustness and reproducibility of our neuronal differentiation method in a multicenter setting, which will be helpful for future research. Synapse formation with mature postsynaptic structures will remain an interesting issue for stem cell-derived neurons, and the present method can be used to obtain early and stable quality neuronal cultures from hiPSC-NPCs.","Human-induced pluripotent stem cell, Neural progenitor cell, Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), Drebrin, PSD-95",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00851-1,2021

We found that SNVs in the subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors, including GRIA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN3A, GRIN3B, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMK2A) are associated with cognitive function.

Additionally, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a downstream target of CaMK2A, was found to activate the expression of CaMK2A, suggesting that MeCP2 and CaMK2A can form a positive feedback loop.

At present, ACKR3 is considered a target for cancer and cardiovascular disorders, but less is known about the potential of ACKR3 as a target for brain disease. Further, mouse lines have been created to identify cells expressing the receptor, but there is no tool to visualize and study the receptor itself under physiological conditions. Here, we engineered a knock-in (KI) mouse expressing a functional ACKR3-Venus fusion protein to directly detect the receptor, particularly in the adult brain. In HEK-293 cells, native and fused receptors showed similar membrane expression, ligand induced trafficking and signaling profiles, indicating that the Venus fusion does not alter receptor signaling. We also found that ACKR3-Venus enables direct real-time monitoring of receptor trafficking using resonance energy transfer. In ACKR3-Venus knock-in mice, we found normal ACKR3 mRNA levels in the brain, suggesting intact gene transcription. We fully mapped receptor expression across 14 peripheral organs and 112 brain areas and found that ACKR3 is primarily localized to the vasculature in these tissues. In the periphery, receptor distribution aligns with previous reports. In the brain there is notable ACKR3 expression in endothelial vascular cells, hippocampal GABAergic interneurons and neuroblast neighboring cells. In conclusion, we have generated Ackr3-Venus knock-in mice with a traceable ACKR3 receptor, which will be a useful tool to the research community for interrogations about ACKR3 biology and related diseases.","CXCR7, GPCR, Signaling, G protein, βarrestin, GABA, Endothelial cells",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00862-y,2021

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been proposed as a clinically useful therapy for several brain diseases. However, the potential role of EA treatment in PTSD and its molecular and cellular mechanisms has rarely been investigated.MethodsWe used an established preclinical social defeat stress mouse model to study whether EA treatment modulates PTSD-like symptoms and understand its underlying mechanisms. To this end, male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) for 6 consecutive days to induce symptoms of PTSD and treated with EA at Baihui (GV 20) and Dazhui (GV 14) acupoints.ResultsThe stimulation of EA, but not needle insertion at Baihui (GV 20) and Dazhui (GV 14) acupoints effectively improved PTSD-like behaviors such as, social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors. However, EA stimulation at the bilateral Tianzong (SI11) acupoints did not affect the PTSD-like behaviors obtained by RSDS. EA stimulation also markedly inhibited astrocyte activation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of RSDS-treated mice. Using next-generation sequencing analysis, our results showed that EA stimulation attenuated RSDS-enhanced lipocalin 2 expression in the hippocampus. Importantly, using double-staining immunofluorescence, we observed that the increased lipocalin 2 expression in astrocytes by RSDS was also reduced by EA stimulation. In addition, intracerebroventricular injection of mouse recombinant lipocalin 2 protein in the lateral ventricles provoked social avoidance, anxiety-like behaviors, and the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the overexpression of lipocalin 2 in the brain also altered the expression of stress-related genes, including monoamine oxidase A, monoamine oxidase B, mineralocorticoid receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the treatment of EA at Baihui (GV 20) and Dazhui (GV 14) acupoints improves RSDS-induced social avoidance, anxiety-like behaviors, astrocyte activation, and lipocalin 2 expression. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that lipocalin 2 expression in the brain may be an important biomarker for the development of PTSD-related symptoms.","Post-traumatic stress disorder, Electroacupuncture, Next-generation sequencing, Lipocalin-2, Intracerebroventricular injection, Repeated social defeat stress",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00860-0,2021

However, a limited number of studies have examined the effect of hypoxia in combination with inflammation (Hypo-Inf) on neural function. We previously reported that neuronal excitability in hippocampal CA1 neurons decreased during hypoxia and greatly rebounded upon reoxygenation. We attributed this altered excitability mainly to the dynamic regulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels and input resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying input resistance changes by Hypo-Inf and reperfusion remained unclear. In the present study, we found that a change in the density of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IDR) can explain the input resistance variability. Furthermore, voltage-dependent inactivation of A-type potassium (IA) channels shifted in the depolarizing direction during Hypo-Inf and reverted to normal upon reperfusion without a significant alteration in the maximum current density. Our results indicate that changes in the input resistance, and consequently excitability, caused by Hypo-Inf and reperfusion are at least partially regulated by the availability and voltage dependence of KV channels. Moreover, these results suggest that selective KV channel modulators can be used as potential neuroprotective drugs to minimize hypoxia- and reperfusion-induced neuronal damage.","Hypoxia, Inflammation, A-type potassium channel, Delayed rectifier potassium channel, Input resistance",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00857-9,2021

Under these conditions, we found that the mRNA levels of Small proline rich protein 1A (Sprr1a) and Annexin A10 (Anxa10), which are the key modulators of neuropathic pain, in the spinal cord were more potently and persistently increased by electrocautery than by incision. Furthermore, these genes were overexpressed almost exclusively in chronic postsurgical pain-activated neurons. This event was associated with decreased levels of tri-methylated histone H3 at Lys27 and increased levels of acetylated histone H3 at Lys27 at their promoter regions. On the other hand, persistent allodynia and overexpression of Sprr1a and Anxa10 after electrocautery were dramatically suppressed by systemic administration of GSK-J4, which is a selective H3K27 demethylase inhibitor.

Upon GPCR activation, astrocytes can respond with transient variations in intracellular Ca2+. In addition, Ca2+-dependent and/or Ca2+-independent release of gliotransmitters can occur, allowing them to engage in bidirectional neuron-astrocyte communication. The development of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) has facilitated many new discoveries on the roles of astrocytes in both physiological and pathological conditions. They are an excellent tool, as they can target endogenous GPCR-mediated intracellular signal transduction pathways specifically in astrocytes. With increasing interest and accumulating research on this topic, several discrepancies on astrocytic Ca2+ signalling and astrocyte-mediated effects on synaptic plasticity have emerged, preventing a clear-cut consensus about the downstream effects of DREADDs in astrocytes. In the present study, we performed a side-by-side evaluation of the effects of bath application of the DREADD agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (10 µM), on Gq- and Gi-DREADD activation in mouse CA1 hippocampal astrocytes. In doing so, we aimed to avoid confounding factors, such as differences in experimental procedures, and to directly compare the actions of both DREADDs on astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampal slices. We used an adeno-associated viral vector approach to transduce dorsal hippocampi of male, 8-week-old C57BL6/J mice, to drive expression of either the Gq-DREADD or Gi-DREADD in CA1 astrocytes. A viral vector lacking the DREADD construct was used to generate controls. Here, we show that agonism of Gq-DREADDs, but not Gi-DREADDs, induced consistent increases in spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ events. Moreover, we demonstrate that both Gq-DREADD as well as Gi-DREADD-mediated activation of CA1 astrocytes induces long-lasting synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 Schaffer collateral pathway in the absence of a high frequency stimulus. Moreover, we report for the first time that astrocytic Gi-DREADD activation is sufficient to elicit de novo potentiation. Our data demonstrate that activation of either Gq or Gi pathways drives synaptic potentiation through Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent mechanisms, respectively.","Astrocytes, Chemogenetics, DREADDs, Calcium imaging, Long-term potentiation, LTP, Hippocampus, Schaffer collateral",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00856-w,2021

A missense mutation (D620N) in VPS35 leads to autosomal-dominant, late-onset Parkinson’s disease. Here, we study the basic neurobiology of VPS35 and Parkinson’s disease mutation effects in the D620N knock-in mouse and the effect of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibition on synaptic phenotypes. The study was conducted using a VPS35 D620N knock-in mouse that expresses VPS35 at endogenous levels. Protein levels, phosphorylation states, and binding ratios in brain lysates from knock-in mice and wild-type littermates were assayed by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot. Dendritic protein co-localization, AMPA receptor surface expression, synapse density, and glutamatergic synapse activity in primary cortical cultures from knock-in and wild-type littermates were assayed using immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. In brain tissue, we confirm VPS35 forms complexes with LRRK2 and AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits, in addition to NMDA-type glutamate receptor GluN1 subunits and D2-type dopamine receptors. Receptor and LRRK2 binding was unaltered in D620N knock-in mice, but we confirm the mutation results in reduced binding of VPS35 with WASH complex member FAM21, and increases phosphorylation of the LRRK2 kinase substrate Rab10, which is reversed by LRRK2 kinase inhibition in vivo. In cultured cortical neurons from knock-in mice, pRab10 is also increased, and reversed by LRRK2 inhibition. The mutation also results in increased endosomal recycling protein cluster density (VPS35-FAM21 co-clusters and Rab11 clusters), glutamate transmission, and GluA1 surface expression. LRRK2 kinase inhibition, which reversed Rab10 hyper-phosphorylation, did not rescue elevated glutamate release or surface GluA1 expression in knock-in neurons, but did alter AMPAR traffic in wild-type cells. The results improve our understanding of the cell biology of VPS35, and the consequences of the D620N mutation in developing neuronal networks. Together the data support a chronic synaptopathy model for latent neurodegeneration, providing phenotypes and candidate pathophysiological stresses that may drive eventual transition to late-stage parkinsonism in VPS35 PD. The study demonstrates the VPS35 mutation has effects that are independent of ongoing LRRK2 kinase activity, and that LRRK2 kinase inhibition alters basal physiology of glutamate synapses in vitro.","Parkinson's disease, Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), NMDA, Dopamine Receptor, Glutamate, Synapses, Synaptic transmission, Knock-in mouse, Retromer, Protein traffic",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00848-w,2021

A number of immediate early genes (IEGs) that are rapidly transcribed in neuronal cells in response to synaptic activity have been used as markers for neuronal activity. However, protein detection of IEGs requires translation, and the amount of newly synthesized gene product is usually insufficient to detect using western blotting, limiting their utility in western blot analysis of brain tissues for comparison of basal activity between control and genetically modified animals. Here, we show that the phosphorylation status of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) rapidly changes in response to synaptic and neural activities. Intraperitoneal injections of the GABA A receptor (GABAAR) antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist brucine rapidly dephosphorylated eEF2. Conversely, potentiation of GABAARs or inhibition of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) induced rapid phosphorylation of eEF2 in both the hippocampus and forebrain of mice. Chemogenetic suppression of hippocampal principal neuron activity promoted eEF2 phosphorylation. Novel context exploration and acute restraint stress rapidly modified the phosphorylation status of hippocampal eEF2. Furthermore, the hippocampal eEF2 phosphorylation levels under basal conditions were reduced in mice exhibiting epilepsy and abnormally enhanced excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Collectively, the results indicated that eEF2 phosphorylation status is sensitive to neural activity and the ratio of phosphorylated eEF2 to total eEF2 could be a molecular signature for estimating neural activity in a specific brain area.","Eukaryotic elongation factor-2, eEF2, Phosphorylation, Dephosphorylation, Neural activity, Brain",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00852-0,2021

The expression and role of AVP exhibit remarkable divergence between these two neuronal populations. Polysynaptic pathways enable these neuronal groups to regulate each other. AVP neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus increase the production of adrenal stress hormones by stimulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Outside the hypothalamus, the medial amygdala also contains robust amounts of AVP. Contrary to the hypothalamic counterpart, the expression of extra-hypothalamic medial amygdala AVP is sexually dimorphic, in that it is preferentially transcribed in males in response to the continual presence of testosterone. Male gonadal hormones typically generate a negative feedback on the neuroendocrine stress axis. Here, we investigated whether testosterone-responsive medial amygdala AVP neurons provide negative feedback to hypothalamic AVP, thereby providing a feedback loop to suppress stress endocrine response during periods of high testosterone secretion. Contrary to our expectation, we found that AVP overexpression within the posterodorsal medial amygdala increased the recruitment of hypothalamic AVP neurons during stress, without affecting the total number of AVP neurons or the number of recently activated neurons following stress. These observations suggest that the effects of testosterone on extra-hypothalamic AVP facilitate stress responsiveness through permissive influence on the recruitment of hypothalamic AVP neurons.","Defensive behaviors, Extended amygdala, Innate fear, Nonapeptides, Paraventricular hypothalamus, Testosterone",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00850-2,2021

We found that BDNF enhanced synaptic responses in a dose-dependent manner in the ACC in C57/BL6 mice. The enhancement was long-lasting, and persisted for at least 3 h. In addition to the enhancement, BDNF also recruited inactive synaptic responses in the ACC. Bath application of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor antagonist K252a blocked BDNF-induced enhancement. L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCC), metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), but not NMDA receptors were required for BDNF-produced enhancement. Moreover, calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1) but not AC8 was essential for the enhancement. A selective AC1 inhibitor NB001 completely blocked the enhancement. Furthermore, BDNF-produced enhancement occluded theta burst stimulation (TBS) induced long-term potentiation (LTP), suggesting that they may share similar signaling mechanisms. Finally, the expression of BDNF-induced enhancement depends on postsynaptic incorporation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ).

In this paper, we aimed to study how the GABAergic system participates in regulating the excitability of ACC PNs, consequently affecting chronic inflammatory pain-related anxiety. A rat model of CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain displayed anxiety-like behaviors, increased the excitability of ACC PNs, and reduced inhibitory presynaptic transmission; however, the number of GAD65/67 was not altered.

However, as there is no physical interaction between them, the underlying mechanism for their coacervation remains unknown. Here, we showed that the coacervation between Syph and Syn is primarily governed by multivalent pi–cation electrostatic interactions among tyrosine residues of Syph C-terminal (Ct) and positively charged Syn. We found that Syph Ct is intrinsically disordered and it alone can form liquid droplets by interactions among themselves at high concentration in a crowding environment in vitro or when assisted by additional interactions by tagging with light-sensitive CRY2PHR or subunits of a multimeric protein in living cells. Syph Ct contains 10 repeated sequences, 9 of them start with tyrosine, and mutating 9 tyrosine to serine (9YS) completely abolished the phase separating property of Syph Ct, indicating tyrosine-mediated pi-interactions are critical. We further found that 9YS mutation failed to coacervate with Syn, and since 9YS retains Syph’s negative charge, the results indicate that pi–cation interactions rather than simple charge interactions are responsible for their coacervation. In addition to revealing the underlying mechanism of Syph and Syn coacervation, our results also raise the possibility that physiological regulation of pi–cation interactions between Syph and Syn during synaptic activity may contribute to the dynamics of synaptic vesicle clustering.","Synaptophysin, Synapsin, Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), Pi–cation interactions, Synaptic vesicle cluster, Presynaptic nerve terminals",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00846-y,2021

Here we sought to identify PAG subregions and cell types which instruct memory formation in response to aversive events. We found that optogenetic inhibition of neurons in the dorsolateral subregion of the PAG (dlPAG), but not the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), during an aversive event reduced memory formation. Furthermore, inhibition of a specific population of thalamus projecting dlPAG neurons projecting to the anterior paraventricular thalamus (aPVT) reduced aversive learning, but had no effect on the expression of previously learned defensive behaviors. By contrast, inactivation of dlPAG neurons which project to the posterior PVT (pPVT) or centromedial intralaminar thalamic nucleus (CM) had no effect on learning. These results reveal specific subregions and cell types within PAG responsible for its learning related functions.","Fear conditioning, Brainstem, Thalamus, Periaqueductal gray",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00844-0,2021

In developmental neuroscience and related research fields, information about the similarities of developmental gene expression patterns between animal models and humans is vital to choose what animal models to employ. Here, we aimed to statistically compare the similarities of developmental changes of gene expression patterns in the brains of humans with those of animal models frequently used in the neuroscience field.MethodsThe developmental gene expression datasets that we analyzed consist of the fold-changes and P values of gene expression in the brains of animals of various ages compared with those of the youngest postnatal animals available in the dataset. By employing the running Fisher algorithm in a bioinformatics platform, BaseSpace, we assessed similarities between the developmental changes of gene expression patterns in the human (Homo sapiens) hippocampus with those in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), the DG of the mouse (Mus musculus), the whole brain of Zebrafish (Danio rerio), and the whole brain of Drosophila (D. melanogaster).ResultsAmong all possible comparisons of different ages and animals in developmental changes in gene expression patterns within the datasets, those between rhesus monkeys and mice were highly similar to those of humans with significant overlap P-value as assessed by the running Fisher algorithm. There was the highest degree of gene expression similarity between 40–59-year-old humans and 6–12-year-old rhesus monkeys (overlap P-value = 2.1 × 10− 72). The gene expression similarity between 20–39-year-old humans and 29-day-old mice was also significant (overlap P = 1.1 × 10− 44). Moreover, there was a similarity in developmental changes of gene expression patterns between 1–2-year-old Zebrafish and 40–59-year-old humans (Overlap P-value = 1.4 × 10− 6). The overlap P-value of developmental gene expression patterns between Drosophila and humans failed to reach significance (30 days Drosophila and 6–11-year-old humans; overlap P-value = 0.0614).ConclusionsThese results indicate that the developmental gene expression changes in the brains of the rhesus monkey, mouse, and Zebrafish recapitulate, to a certain degree, those in humans. Our findings support the idea that these animal models are a valid tool for investigating the development of the brain in neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric studies.","Gene expression, Development, Human, Rhesus monkey, Mouse, Zebrafish, Drosophila, RNA-seq",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00840-4,2021

However, when recombinant GDF11 (rGDF11) is administered systemically in aged mice, it promotes neurogenesis, the opposite of its role during development. The goal of the present study was to reconcile this apparent discrepancy by performing the first detailed investigation into the expression of endogenous GDF11 in the adult brain and its effects on neurogenesis. Using quantitative histological analysis, we observed that Gdf11 is most highly expressed in adult neurogenic niches and non-neurogenic regions within the hippocampus, choroid plexus, thalamus, habenula, and cerebellum. To investigate the role of endogenous GDF11 during adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we generated a tamoxifen inducible mouse that allowed us to reduce GDF11 levels. Depletion of Gdf11 during adulthood increased proliferation of neural progenitors and decreased the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus, suggesting that endogenous GDF11 remains a negative regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. These findings further support the idea that circulating systemic GDF11 and endogenously expressed GDF11 in the adult brain have different target cells or mechanisms of action. Our data describe a role for GDF11-dependent signaling in adult neurogenesis that has implications for how GDF11 may be used to treat CNS disease.","GDF11, Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, Neural progenitor cells, Proliferation, Knockout mouse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00845-z,2021

The protective effects of C8 and C10 have been proposed to be driven by hepatic production of ketone bodies. However, plasma ketone levels correlates poorly with the cerebral effects of C8 and C10, suggesting that additional mechanism are in place. Here we investigated cellular C8 and C10 metabolism in the brain and explored how the protective effects of C8 and C10 may be linked to cellular metabolism. Using dynamic isotope labeling, with [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 as metabolic substrates, we show that both C8 and C10 are oxidatively metabolized in mouse brain slices. The 13C enrichment from metabolism of [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 was particularly prominent in glutamine, suggesting that C8 and C10 metabolism primarily occurs in astrocytes. This finding was corroborated in cultured astrocytes in which C8 increased the respiration linked to ATP production, whereas C10 elevated the mitochondrial proton leak. When C8 and C10 were provided together as metabolic substrates in brain slices, metabolism of C10 was predominant over that of C8. Furthermore, metabolism of both [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 was unaffected by etomoxir indicating that it is independent of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1). Finally, we show that inhibition of glutamine synthesis selectively reduced 13C accumulation in GABA from [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 metabolism in brain slices, demonstrating that the glutamine generated from astrocyte C8 and C10 metabolism is utilized for neuronal GABA synthesis. Collectively, the results show that cerebral C8 and C10 metabolism is linked to the metabolic coupling of neurons and astrocytes, which may serve as a protective metabolic mechanism of C8 and C10 supplementation in neurological disorders.","MCT, MCFA, Neurotransmitter recycling, Mitochondria, β-hydroxybutyrate, Caprylic acid (C8), Capric acid (C10)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00842-2,2021

Loss of PTEN has been linked to an array of human diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as macrocephaly and autism. However, it remains unknown whether increased dosage of PTEN can lead to human disease. A recent human genetics study identifies chromosome 10 microduplication encompassing PTEN in patients with microcephaly. Here we generated a human brain organoid model of increased PTEN dosage. We showed that mild PTEN overexpression led to reduced neural precursor proliferation, premature neuronal differentiation, and the formation of significantly smaller brain organoids. PTEN overexpression resulted in decreased AKT activation, and treatment of wild-type organoids with an AKT inhibitor recapitulated the reduced brain organoid growth phenotypes. Together, our findings provide functional evidence that PTEN is a dosage-sensitive gene that regulates human neurodevelopment, and that increased PTEN dosage in brain organoids results in microcephaly-like phenotypes.","PTEN, AKT, Brain organoids, Human pluripotent stem cells, Neural precursors, Microcephaly, Neurodevelopmental disorder",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00841-3,2021

Excitatory synapses onto SOM-INs show a Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by type 1a metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1a) that is implicated in hippocampus-dependent learning. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) is also critical for hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory. SST effects on hippocampal PCs are well documented, but its actions on inhibitory interneurons remain largely undetermined. In the present work, we investigate the involvement of SST in long-term potentiation of CA1 SOM-IN excitatory synapses using pharmacological approaches targeting the somatostatinergic system and whole cell recordings in slices from transgenic mice expressing eYFP in SOM-INs. We report that application of exogenous SST14 induces long-term potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in SOM-INs via somatostatin type 1–5 receptors (SST1-5Rs) but does not affect synapses of PC or parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Hebbian LTP in SOM-INs was prevented by inhibition of SSTRs and by depletion of SST by cysteamine treatment, suggesting a critical role of endogenous SST in LTP. LTP of SOM-IN excitatory synapses induced by SST14 was independent of NMDAR and mGluR1a, activity-dependent, and prevented by blocking GABAA receptor function. Our results indicate that endogenous SST may contribute to Hebbian LTP at excitatory synapses of SOM-INs by controlling GABAA inhibition, uncovering a novel role for SST in regulating long-term synaptic plasticity in somatostatinergic cells that may be important for hippocampus-dependent memory processes.","GABA interneurons, Somatotropin-release inhibitory factor—SRIF, Whole cell recordings, Cysteamine, SST1-5 receptors, Disinhibition, GABAA inhibition, Hebbian LTP",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00830-6,2021

The expression of PSD95, a vital synaptic scaffolding molecule, is down-regulated by hypobaric hypoxia exposure and post-transcriptionally regulated by cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirbp) through 3′-UTR region binding.

The hippocampus is vulnerable to acute sleep deprivation with changes in gene expression, cell signaling, and protein synthesis. Sleep deprivation also has long lasting effects on memory and performance that persist after recovery sleep, as seen in behavioral studies from invertebrates to humans. Although previous research has shown that acute sleep deprivation impacts gene expression, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects gene regulation remains unknown. Using an unbiased deep RNA sequencing approach, we investigated the effects of acute sleep deprivation on gene expression in the hippocampus. We identified 1,146 genes that were significantly dysregulated following sleep deprivation with 507 genes upregulated and 639 genes downregulated, including protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs not previously identified as impacted by sleep deprivation. Notably, genes significantly upregulated after sleep deprivation were associated with RNA splicing and the nucleus. In contrast, downregulated genes were associated with cell adhesion, dendritic localization, the synapse, and postsynaptic membrane. Furthermore, we found through independent experiments analyzing a subset of genes that three hours of recovery sleep following acute sleep deprivation was sufficient to normalize mRNA abundance for most genes, although exceptions occurred for some genes that may affect RNA splicing or transcription. These results clearly demonstrate that sleep deprivation differentially regulates gene expression on multiple transcriptomic levels to impact hippocampal function.","Memory, Transcription, Sleep deprivation, Hippocampus, Gene expression, Transcriptome, Translatome, RNA sequencing",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00835-1,2021

Inhibition of autophagy by CRMP2-derived peptide ST2-104 (R9-CBD3) via a CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR pathway contributes to ischemic postconditioning-induced neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury,"Yuan Yao1 na1,, Yingshi Ji1 na1,, Jinghong Ren1,, Huanyu Liu1,, Rajesh Khanna2 &, Li Sun3","Rajesh Khanna, Li Sun","rkhanna@arizona.edu, sunli99@jlu.edu.cn",2021-08-06,"Cerebral ischemia, a common cerebrovascular disease, is characterized by functional deficits and apoptotic cell death. Autophagy, a type of programmed cell death, plays critical roles in controlling neuronal damage and metabolic homeostasis, and has been inextricably linked to cerebral ischemia. We previously identified a short peptide aptamer from collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), designated the Ca2+ channel-binding domain 3 (CBD3) peptide, that conferred protection against excitotoxicity and traumatic brain injury. ST2-104, a nona-arginine (R9)-fused CBD3 peptide, exerted beneficial effects on neuropathic pain and was neuroprotective in a model of Alzheimer’s disease; however, the effect of ST2-104 on cerebral ischemia and its mechanism of action have not been studied. In this study, we modeled cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats with the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as well as challenged SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with glutamate to induce toxicity to interrogate the effects of ST2-104 on autophagy following ischemic/excitotoxic insults. ST2-104 reduced the infarct volume and improved the neurological score of rats subjected to MCAO. ST2-104 protected SH-SY5Y cells from death following glutamate exposure via blunting apoptosis and autophagy as well as limiting excessive calcium entry. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of autophagy, promoted the effects of ST2-104 in inhibiting apoptosis triggered by glutamate while rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, failed to do so. ST2-104 peptide reversed glutamate-induced apoptosis via inhibiting Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ)-mediated autophagy, which was partly enhanced by STO-609 (an inhibitor of CaMKKβ). ST2-104 attenuated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy through CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR pathway. Our results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of ST2-104 are due to actions on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy via the CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. The findings present novel insights into the potential neuroprotection of ST2-104 in cerebral ischemia.","Cerebral ischemia injury, Glutamate, CRMP2, Apoptosis, Autophagy, CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR pathway",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00836-0,2021

Hence, identifying novel epileptogenic markers to aid in the localization of EZ in patients with FCD is very much needed. High-throughput gene expression studies of FCD samples have the potential to uncover molecular changes underlying the epileptogenic process and identify novel markers for delineating the EZ. For this purpose, we, for the first time performed RNA sequencing of surgically resected paired tissue samples obtained from electrocorticographically graded high (MAX) and low spiking (MIN) regions of FCD type II patients and autopsy controls. We identified significant changes in the MAX samples of the FCD type II patients when compared to non-epileptic controls, but not in the case of MIN samples. We found significant enrichment for myelination, oligodendrocyte development and differentiation, neuronal and axon ensheathment, phospholipid metabolism, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton, semaphorins, and ion channels in the MAX region.

Efnb2 is a membrane-bound molecule that plays an important role in the nervous system through binding the Eph receptor. To investigate whether the loss of Efnb2 in PV+ affects anxiety, we examined the behavior of wild type and Efnb2 in PV+ neurons knockout (KO) mice. We monitored the defensive responses to aversive stimuli of elevated plus maze (EPM) and found that KO mice exhibited obvious fearless and anxiolytic behaviors. To further investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing, analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and constructed the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The WGCNA identified 12 characteristic modules. Among them, the MEgreen module showed the most significant correlation with KO mice of EPM stimuli. The Gene Ontology enrichment and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that this was related to the distal axon, Ras signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the whole-cell voltage clamp recordings also proved that Efnb2 gene knock-out could affect synaptic function. Together with the transcriptomic analysis of mice with Efnb2 knockout on PV+ neurons, our findings suggest that Efnb2 gene in the PV+ neuron of PFC may be a crucial factor for fear and anxiety, which provide an insight into anxiety pathophysiology.","Efnb2, Anxiety, RNA-seq, WGCNA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00829-z,2021

A key regulator of this process is mTORC1, a complex comprising the mTOR kinase. Growth factors activate mTORC1 via a pathway involving PI3-kinase, Akt, the TSC complex and the GTPase Rheb. In non-neuronal cells, translocation of mTORC1 to late endocytic compartments (LEs), where Rheb is enriched, is triggered by amino acids. However, the regulation of mTORC1 in neurons remains unclear. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we observed that BDNF and treatments activating NMDA receptors trigger a robust increase in mTORC1 activity. NMDA receptors activation induced a significant recruitment of mTOR onto lysosomes even in the absence of external amino acids, whereas mTORC1 was evenly distributed in neurons under resting conditions. NMDA receptor-induced mTOR translocation to LEs was partly dependent on the BDNF receptor TrkB, suggesting that BDNF contributes to the effect of NMDA receptors on mTORC1 translocation. In addition, the combination of Rheb overexpression and artificial mTORC1 targeting to LEs by means of a modified component of mTORC1 fused with a LE-targeting motif strongly activated mTOR. To gain spatial and temporal control over mTOR localization, we designed an optogenetic module based on light-sensitive dimerizers able to recruit mTOR on LEs. In cells expressing this optogenetic tool, mTOR was translocated to LEs upon photoactivation. In the absence of growth factor, this was not sufficient to activate mTORC1. In contrast, mTORC1 was potently activated by a combination of BDNF and photoactivation. The data demonstrate that two important triggers of synaptic plasticity, BDNF and NMDA receptors, synergistically power the two arms of the mTORC1 activation mechanism, i.e., mTORC1 translocation to LEs and Rheb activation.

To address this, we employed a 10-plex tandem isobaric mass tag approach in combination with an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography MS/MS (Q-Exactive) method, to interrogate unbiased proteomic changes in cerebrovessels from AD and healthy control brains with different APOE genotypes. We first interrogated changes between healthy control cases to identify underlying genotype specific effects in cerebrovessels. EIF2 signaling, regulation of eIF4 and 70S6K signaling and mTOR signaling were the top significantly altered pathways in E4/E4 compared to E3/E3 cases. Oxidative phosphorylation, EIF2 signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction were the top significant pathways in E2E2 vs E3/E3cases. We also identified AD-dependent changes and their interactions with APOE genotype and found the highest number of significant proteins from this interaction was observed in the E3/E4 (192) and E4/E4 (189) cases.

These proteomic changes provide novel insights into the longstanding link between APOE4 and cerebrovascular dysfunction, implicating a role for impaired autophagy, ER stress, and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

We previously demonstrated the regenerative effect of the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, on an excitotoxic cochlear nerve damage model in vitro. In this study, we aimed to validate the effect of ROCK inhibition on mice with cochlear synaptopathy induced by laser-induced shock wave (LISW) in vivo.

In this study, we further examined this role by recording orexin neuronal activity and heart rate in freely moving mice using an original dual-channel fiber photometry system in vivo. Analysis of orexin neuron activity in relation to autonomic responses to aversive stimuli revealed a rapid increase in neuronal activity just prior to changes in heart rate. In addition, we examined whether orexin neurons would be activated by a conditioned neutral sound that was previously associated with aversive stimulus. We show that the memory of the aversive stimulus activated orexin neurons and increased heart rate.

Immediate early genes (IEGs) are widely used as a marker for neuronal plasticity. Here, we model the dynamics of IEG expression as a consecutive, irreversible first-order reaction with a limiting substrate. First, we develop an analytical framework to show that such a model, together with two-photon in vivo imaging of IEG expression, can be used to identify distinct neuronal subsets representing multiple memories. Using the above combination, we show that the expression kinetics, rather than intensity threshold, can be used to identify neuronal ensembles responding to the presentation of two events in vivo. The analytical expression allowed us to segregate the neurons based on their temporal response to one specific behavioural event, thereby improving the ability to detect plasticity related neurons. We image the retrosplenial cortex (RSc) of cfos-GFP transgenic mice to follow the dynamics of cellular changes resulting from contextual fear conditioning behaviour, enabling us to establish a representation of context in RSc at the cellular scale following memory acquisition. Thus, we obtain a general method that distinguishes neurons that took part in multiple temporally separated events by measuring fluorescence of individual neurons in live mice.","cfos expression, Neuronal ensembles, Dual context exposure, Retrosplenial cortex, IEGs, Two-photon, In vivo imaging",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00798-3,2021

Recent studies demonstrate that cocaine affects mitochondrial dynamics and morphological characteristics within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Further, mitochondria are differentially regulated by cocaine in dopamine receptor-1 containing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) vs dopamine receptor-2 (D2)-MSNs. However, there is little understanding into cocaine-induced transcriptional mechanisms and their role in regulating mitochondrial processes. Here, we demonstrate that cocaine enhances binding of the transcription factor, early growth response factor 3 (Egr3), to nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function and dynamics. Moreover, cocaine exposure regulates mRNA of these mitochondria-associated nuclear genes in both contingent or noncontingent cocaine administration and in both rodent models and human postmortem tissue. Interestingly, several mitochondrial nuclear genes showed distinct profiles of expression in D1-MSNs vs D2-MSNs, with cocaine exposure generally increasing mitochondrial-associated nuclear gene expression in D1-MSNs vs suppression in D2-MSNs. Further, blunting Egr3 expression in D1-MSNs blocks cocaine-enhancement of the mitochondrial-associated transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC1α), and the mitochondrial fission molecule, dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1). Finally, reduction of D1-MSN Egr3 expression attenuates cocaine-induced enhancement of small-sized mitochondria, causally demonstrating that Egr3 regulates mitochondrial morphological adaptations. Collectively, these studies demonstrate cocaine exposure impacts mitochondrial dynamics and morphology by Egr3 transcriptional regulation of mitochondria-related nuclear gene transcripts; indicating roles for these molecular mechanisms in neuronal function and plasticity occurring with cocaine exposure.","Cocaine, D1-MSNs, D2-MSNs, Mitochondria, Nucleus accumbens",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00800-y,2021

In this study, we investigated whether the loss of Epac2, involved in the mTOR-independent pathway, affects autophagy activity and whether the activity of autophagy is associated with social–behavioral phenotypes in mice with Epac2 deficiencies. We observed an accumulation of autophagosomes and a significant increase in autophagic flux in Epac2-deficient neurons, which had no effect on mTOR activity. Next, we examined whether an increase in autophagic activity contributed to the social behavior exhibited in Epac2−/− mice. The social recognition deficit observed in Epac2−/− mice recovered in double transgenic Epac2−/−: Atg5+/− mice.

However, it is unknown how well they capture age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are only present during the earliest stages of mammalian development. Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with chronological age. It has been shown that the induction of pluripotency rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not optimized for the study of brain development, we developed the fetal brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in human prenatal brain samples in order to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons. The FBC was tested in two independent validation cohorts across a total of 194 samples, confirming that the FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in fetal brain cohorts. We applied the FBC to DNA methylation data from iPSCs and embryonic stem cells and their derived neuronal precursor cells and neurons, finding that these cell types are epigenetically characterized as having an early fetal age. Furthermore, while differentiation from iPSCs to neurons significantly increases epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons are still predicted as being fetal. Together our findings reiterate the need to better understand the limitations of existing epigenetic clocks for answering biological research questions and highlight a limitation of iPSC-neurons as a cellular model of age-related diseases.","Epigenetic clock, DNA methylation, Fetal, Neurodevelopment, Induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSC-derived neurons, Neuronal precursor cells, DNAm clock",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00810-w,2021

Recent studies demonstrate that increasing neurogenesis after memory formation induces forgetting of previously acquired memories. Neurogenesis-induced forgetting was originally demonstrated in mice, but a recent report suggests that the same effect may be absent in rats. Although a general species difference is possible, other potential explanations for these incongruent findings are that memories which are more strongly reinforced become resilient to forgetting or that perhaps only certain types of memories are affected. Here, we investigated whether neurogenesis-induced forgetting occurs in rats using several hippocampus-dependent tasks including contextual fear conditioning (CFC), the Morris Water Task (MWT), and touchscreen paired associates learning (PAL). Neurogenesis was increased following training using voluntary exercise for 4 weeks before recall of the previous memory was assessed. We show that voluntary running causes forgetting of context fear memories in a neurogenesis-dependent manner, and that neurogenesis-induced forgetting is present in rats across behavioral tasks despite differences in complexity or reliance on spatial, context, or object memories. In addition, we asked whether stronger memories are less susceptible to forgetting by varying the strength of training. Even with a very strong training protocol in the CFC task, we still observed enhanced forgetting related to increased neurogenesis. These results suggest that forgetting due to neurogenesis is a conserved mechanism that aids in the clearance of memories.","Neurogenesis, Forgetting, Hippocampus, Morris Water Task, Contextual fear conditioning, Paired Associates Learning, Touchscreens",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00808-4,2021

While reduced midbrain GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to the hyperdopaminergia thought to underpin psychosis in schizophrenia, molecular changes consistent with this have not been reported. We hypothesised that reduced GABA-related molecular markers would be found in the midbrain of people with schizophrenia and that these would correlate with dopaminergic molecular changes. We hypothesised that downregulation of inhibitory neuron markers would be exacerbated in schizophrenia cases with high levels of neuroinflammation. Eight GABAergic-related transcripts were measured with quantitative PCR, and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 and GABAA alpha 3 (α3) (GABRA3) protein were measured with immunoblotting, in post-mortem midbrain (28/28 and 28/26 control/schizophrenia cases for mRNA and protein, respectively), and analysed by both diagnosis and inflammatory subgroups (as previously defined by higher levels of four pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts). We found reductions (21 – 44%) in mRNA encoding both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), GAD1, and parvalbumin (PV) mRNAs and four alpha subunits (α1, α2, α3, α5) of the GABAA receptor in people with schizophrenia compared to controls (p < 0.05).

Overexpression of CTGF in the right mPFC using viral transduction induces social avoidance while the left mPFC thereof prevent stress-induced social avoidance. Our study provides a molecular window into the mechanism of stress-induced socioemotional disorders, which can pave the way for new interventions by targeting cortical asymmetry.","Molecular laterality, Social defeat stress, Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Medial prefrontal cortex, Depression",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00802-w,2021

The underlying mechanisms of the NGLY1 phenotype are poorly understood, and no effective therapy is currently available. Similar to human patients, the rat model of NGLY1 deficiency, Ngly1−/−, shows developmental delay, movement disorder, somatosensory impairment, scoliosis, and learning disability. Here we show that single intracerebroventricular administration of AAV9 expressing human NGLY1 cDNA (AAV9-hNGLY1) to Ngly1−/− rats during the weaning period restored NGLY1 expression in the brain and spinal cord, concomitant with increased enzymatic activity of NGLY1 in the brain. hNGLY1 protein expressed by AAV9 was found predominantly in mature neurons, but not in glial cells, of Ngly1−/− rats. Strikingly, intracerebroventricular administration of AAV9-hNGLY1 normalized the motor phenotypes of Ngly1−/− rats assessed by the rota-rod test and gait analysis. The reversibility of motor deficits in Ngly1−/− rats by central nervous system (CNS)-restricted gene delivery suggests that the CNS is the primary therapeutic target organs for NGLY1 deficiency, and that the Ngly1−/− rat model may be useful for evaluating therapeutic treatments in pre-clinical studies.","Ngly1, Motor dysfunction, Ngly1 deficient rats",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00806-6,2021

The short form of Homer only has the N-terminal domain and likely acts as a dominant negative regulator. Homer2a, one of the long form isoforms of the Homer family, expresses with a transient peak in the early postnatal stage of mouse cerebellar granule cells (CGCs); however, the functions of Homer2a in CGCs are not fully understood yet. In this study, we investigated the physiological roles of Homer2a in CGCs using recombinant adenovirus vectors. Overexpression of the Homer2a N-terminal domain construct, which was made structurally reminiscent with Homer1a, altered NMDAR1 localization, decreased NMDA currents, and promoted the survival of CGCs. These results suggest that the Homer2a N-terminal domain acts as a dominant negative protein to attenuate NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity. Moreover, we identified a novel short form N-terminal domain-containing Homer2, named Homer2e, which was induced by apoptotic stimulation such as ischemic brain injury.

Distinct gene expression profiles are reported to define each of these microglial reaction states. Hence, the identification of modulators of selective microglial transcriptomic signature, which have the potential to regulate unique microglial function has gained interest. Here, we report the identification of ATG7 (Autophagy-related 7) as a selective modulator of an NF-κB-dependent transcriptional program controlling the pro-inflammatory response of microglia. We also uncover that microglial Atg7-deficiency was associated with reduced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity, and thus a loss of biological function associated with the pro-inflammatory microglial reactive state. Further, we show that Atg7-deficiency in microglia did not impact on their ability to respond to alternative stimulus, such as one driving them towards an anti-inflammatory/tumor supportive phenotype. The identification of distinct regulators, such as Atg7, controlling specific microglial transcriptional programs could lead to developing novel therapeutic strategies aiming to manipulate selected microglial phenotypes, instead of the whole microglial population with is associated with several pitfalls.","Atg7, Inflammatory response, Microglia, Neurotoxicity, NF-κB, Transcriptome",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00794-7,2021

The present paper summarizes methodological issues and experiences gained from studies on the distribution of synaptic and other neuron-specific proteins in cell cultures and brain tissues via a pre-embedding method. An optimal protocol includes careful determination of a fixation condition for any particular antibody, a well-planned tissue processing procedure, and a strict evaluation of the credibility of the labeling. Here, tips and caveats on different steps of the sample preparation protocol are illustrated with examples. A good starting condition for EM-compatible fixation and permeabilization is 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 30 min incubation with 0.1% saponin. An optimal condition can then be readjusted for each particular antibody. Each lot of the secondary antibody (conjugated with a 1.4 nm small gold particle) needs to be evaluated against known standards for labeling efficiency. Silver enhancement is required to make the small gold visible, and quality of the silver-enhanced signals can be affected by subsequent steps of osmium tetroxide treatment, uranyl acetate en bloc staining, and by detergent or ethanol used to clean the diamond knife for cutting thin sections. Most importantly, verification of signals requires understanding of the protein of interest in order to validate for correct localization of antibodies at expected epitopes on particular organelles, and quantification of signals needs to take into consideration the penetration gradient of reagents and clumping of secondary antibodies.","Synaptic proteins, Electron microscopy, Immunogold labeling",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00799-2,2021
Inactivation of Presenilin in inhibitory neurons results in decreased GABAergic responses and enhanced synaptic plasticity,"Sang Hun Lee1,, Vadim Y.

Presenilin (PS) is highly expressed in the hippocampus, which is particularly vulnerable in AD. Previous studies of PS function in the hippocampus, however, focused exclusively on excitatory neurons. Whether PS regulates inhibitory neuronal function remained unknown. In the current study, we investigate PS function in GABAergic neurons by performing whole-cell and field-potential electrophysiological recordings using acute hippocampal slices from inhibitory neuron-specific PS conditional double knockout (IN-PS cDKO) mice at 2 months of age, before the onset of age-dependent loss of interneurons. We found that the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) is reduced in hippocampal CA1 neurons of IN-PS cDKO mice, whereas the amplitude of sIPSCs is normal. Moreover, the efficacy of inhibitory neurotransmission as assessed with synaptic input/output relations for evoked mono- and di-synaptic IPSCs is markedly lowered in hippocampal CA1 neurons of IN-PS cDKO mice. Consistent with these findings, IN-PS cDKO mice display enhanced paired-pulse facilitation, frequency facilitation and long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. Interestingly, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibition of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase results in a reduction of IPSC amplitude in control hippocampal neurons but not in IN-PS cDKO neurons, suggesting that impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis in the absence of PS may contribute to the deficiencies in inhibitory neurotransmission. Furthermore, the amplitude of IPSCs induced by short trains of presynaptic stimulation and paired-pulse ratio are decreased in IN-PS cDKO mice. These findings show that inactivation of PS in interneurons results in decreased GABAergic responses and enhanced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, providing additional evidence for the importance of PS in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and calcium homeostasis.","Alzheimer’s disease, Interneuron, Conditional knockout, Hippocampus, Schaffer collateral, Short-term synaptic plasticity, Long-term potentiation, Calcium homeostasis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00796-5,2021

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of hearing loss remain unclear. Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1) enables efficient intramitochondrial translation by catalyzing the deposition of 2-methylthio modifications on mitochondrial tRNAs. Here we investigated the effect of defective mitochondrial protein translation on hearing and AHL in a Cdk5rap1 deficiency C57BL/6 mouse model. Compared to control C57BL/6 mice, Cdk5rap1-knockout female mice displayed hearing loss phenotypically similar to AHL from an early age. The premature hearing loss in Cdk5rap1-knockout mice was associated with the degeneration of the spiral ligament and reduction of endocochlear potentials following the loss of auditory sensory cells. Furthermore, cultured primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed early onset of cellular senescence associated with high oxidative stress and cell death. These results indicate that the CDK5RAP1 deficiency-induced defective mitochondrial translation might cause early hearing loss through the induction of cellular senescence and cochlear dysfunction in the inner ear. Our results suggest that the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria might promote AHL progression. Furthermore, our findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated mitochondrial tRNA modifications mechanistically cause AHL. Understanding the mechanisms underlying AHL will guide future clinical investigations and interventions in the attempt to mitigate the consequences of AHL.","Auditory brainstem responses, Cdk5rap1, Endocochlear potentials, Hearing loss, Mitochondrial tRNA, Spiral ligament of cochlea",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00791-w,2021

Furthermore, the formalin-induced Ca2+ response was dramatically decreased by the loss of α1A-adrenaline receptors (ARs) in astrocytes located in the superficial laminae of the SDH. Moreover, similar inhibition was observed in mice pretreated intrathecally with an α1A-AR-specific antagonist.

We were surprised to find that expression of all NMDA receptor subunits was greatly enhanced in mGlu5−/− mice at PND21. In contrast, at PND9, expression of the GluN2B subunit was enhanced, whereas expression of GluN2A and GluN2D subunits was reduced in both regions.

Changes in the transcripts of interneuron-related genes (encoding parvalbumin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, reelin, and the two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase) were also observed in mGlu5−/− mice across postnatal development. For example, the transcript encoding parvalbumin was up-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of mGlu5−/− mice at PND9 and PND21, whereas it was significantly reduced at PND75. These findings suggest that in mGlu5−/− mice a transient overexpression of NMDA receptor subunits may compensate for the lack of the NMDA receptor partner, mGlu5. Interestingly, in mGlu5−/− mice the behavioral response to the NMDA channel blocker, MK-801, was significantly increased at PND21, and largely reduced at PND75.

Our patch-clamp data suggest that the exchange of the AMPA receptors depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), via protein degradation. Ziram (50 µM), a ubiquitination inhibitor, reduces the turnover of the AMPA receptors. CO2 inhalation with retrieval boosts the ubiquitination without altering the proteasome activity. Several calcium-dependent kinases potentially involved in the CO2-inhalation regulated memory liability were identified using the Kinome assay. These results suggest that the UPS plays a key role in regulating the turnover of AMPA receptors during CO2 inhalation.","Carbon dioxide, Acid‐sensing ion channels, Reconsolidation, Aversive conditioning, Memory retrieval, AMPA receptors, Ubiquitination, Proteasome, Protein degradation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00786-7,2021

We investigated the role of IL-19 in ALS using transgenic mice carrying human superoxide dismutase 1 with the G93A mutation (SOD1G93A Tg mice). We generated IL-19–deficient SOD1G93A Tg (IL-19−/−/SOD1G93A Tg) mice by crossing SOD1G93A Tg mice with IL-19−/− mice, and then evaluated disease progression, motor function, survival rate, and pathological and biochemical alternations in the resultant mice. In addition, we assessed the effect of IL-19 on glial cells using primary microglia and astrocyte cultures from the embryonic brains of SOD1G93A Tg mice and IL-19−/−/SOD1G93A Tg mice. Expression of IL-19 in primary microglia and lumbar spinal cord was higher in SOD1G93A Tg mice than in wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, IL-19−/−/SOD1G93A Tg mice exhibited significant improvement of motor function. Ablation of IL-19 in SOD1G93A Tg mice increased expression of both neurotoxic and neuroprotective factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and transforming growth factor β1, in lumbar spinal cord. Primary microglia and astrocytes from IL-19−/−/SOD1G93A Tg mice expressed higher levels of TNF-α, resulting in release of GDNF from astrocytes.

We investigated the role of the Drosophila OPHN1 ortholog Graf in the development of the mushroom body (MB), a key brain structure for learning and memory in insects. We show that loss of Graf causes abnormal crossing of the MB β lobe over the brain midline during metamorphosis. This defect in Graf mutants is rescued by MB-specific expression of Graf and OPHN1. Furthermore, MB α/β neuron-specific RNA interference experiments and mosaic analyses indicate that Graf acts via a cell-autonomous mechanism. Consistent with the negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by Graf, activation of this pathway is required for the β-lobe midline-crossing phenotype of Graf mutants. Finally, Graf mutants have impaired olfactory long-term memory.

We first tested Prdx6−/− mice on a Morris water maze task and found that their memory performance was defective, along with reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses recorded from hippocampal sections of home-caged mice. Surprisingly, after the probe test, these knockout mice exhibited elevated hippocampal LTP, higher phosphorylated ERK1/2 level, and decreased reactive astrocyte markers. We further reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by administering MEK inhibitor, U0126, into Prdx6−/− mice before the probe test, which reversed  their spatial memory deficit.

This chromosomal deletion is known as high genetic risk factors for various psychiatric disorders. The different deletion types are identified in 22q11.2DS patients, including the most common 3.0-Mb deletion, and the less-frequent 1.5-Mb and 1.4-Mb deletions. In previous animal studies of psychiatric disorders associated with 22q11.2DS mainly focused on the 1.5-Mb deletion and model mice mimicking the human 1.5-Mb deletion have been established with diverse genetic backgrounds, which resulted in the contradictory phenotypes. On the other hand, the contribution of the genes in 1.4-Mb region to psychiatric disorders is poorly understood. In this study, we generated two mouse lines that reproduced the 1.4-Mb and 1.5-Mb deletions of 22q11.2DS [Del(1.4 Mb)/+ and Del(1.5 Mb)/+] on the pure C57BL/6N genetic background. These mutant mice were analyzed comprehensively by behavioral tests, such as measurement of locomotor activity, sociability, prepulse inhibition and fear-conditioning memory. Del(1.4 Mb)/+ mice displayed decreased locomotor activity, but no abnormalities were observed in all other behavioral tests. Del(1.5 Mb)/+ mice showed reduction of prepulse inhibition and impairment of contextual- and cued-dependent fear memory, which is consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, apparently intact social recognition in Del(1.4 Mb)/+ and Del(1.5 Mb)/+ mice suggests that the impaired social recognition observed in Del(3.0 Mb)/+ mice mimicking the human 3.0-Mb deletion requires mutations both in 1.4-Mb and 1.5 Mb regions. Our previous study has shown that Del(3.0 Mb)/+ mice presented disturbance of behavioral circadian rhythm. Therefore, we further evaluated sleep/wakefulness cycles in Del(3.0 Mb)/+ mice by electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) recording. EEG/EMG analysis revealed the disturbed wakefulness and non-rapid eye moving sleep (NREMS) cycles in Del(3.0 Mb)/+ mice, suggesting that Del(3.0 Mb)/+ mice may be unable to maintain their wakefulness.

The membrane excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission of layer 5a neurons were increased. Consequently, the organization of the barrels was impaired. Moreover, layer 4 spiny stellate cells were not able to properly gather, leading to abnormal formation of barrel walls as the ratio of barrel/septum size obviously decreased.

Palmitate inhibited starvation-induced ER-phagy by increasing the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein, which inhibits autophagy initiation.

Although a certain degree of heterogeneity among GCs has been recently reported, variability of GC responses to MF inputs has never been associated with their most notable structural variability, location of their projecting PFs in the ML. Here, we utilize an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated labeling technique that enables us to categorize GCs according to the location of their PFs, and compare the Ca2+ responses to MF stimulations between three groups of GCs, consisting of either GCs having PFs at the deep (D-GCs), middle (M-GCs), or superficial (S-GCs) sublayer. Our structural analysis revealed that there was no correlation between position of GC soma in the GC layer and location of its PF in the ML, confirming that our AAV-mediated labeling was important to test the projection-dependent variability of the Ca2+ responses in GCs. We then found that the Ca2+ responses of D-GCs differed from those of M-GCs. Pharmacological experiments implied that the different Ca2+ responses were mainly attributable to varied distributions of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) at the synaptic and extrasynaptic regions of GC dendrites. In addition to GABAAR distributions, amounts of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors appear to be also varied, because Ca2+ responses were different between D-GCs and M-GCs when glutamate spillover was enhanced. Whereas the Ca2+ responses of S-GCs were mostly equivalent to those of D-GCs and M-GCs, the blockade of GABA uptake resulted in larger Ca2+ responses in S-GCs compared with D-GCs and M-GCs, implying existence of mechanisms leading to more excitability in S-GCs with increased GABA release. Thus, this study reveals MF stimulation-mediated non-uniform Ca2+ responses in the cerebellar GCs associated with the location of their PFs in the ML, and raises a possibility that combination of inherent functional variability of GCs and their specific axonal projection contributes to the information processing through the GCs.","Cerebellar granule cells, Calcium imaging, AAV-driven labeling, Heterogeneity, Receptor distributions",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00773-y,2021

The contribution of each gene in this syndrome has been studied using mutant mouse models, but no single mouse model recapitulates the whole spectrum of human 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. The behavior of Trpm1−/− mice has not been investigated in relation to 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome due to the visual impairment in these mice, which may confound the results of behavioral tests involving vision. We were able to perform a comprehensive behavioral test battery using Trpm1 null mutant mice to investigate the role of Trpm1, which is thought to be expressed solely in the retina, in the central nervous system and to examine the relationship between TRPM1 and 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Our data demonstrate that Trpm1−/− mice exhibit abnormal behaviors that may explain some phenotypes of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, including reduced anxiety-like behavior, abnormal social interaction, attenuated fear memory, and the most prominent phenotype of Trpm1 mutant mice, hyperactivity. While the ON visual transduction pathway is impaired in Trpm1−/− mice, we did not detect compensatory high sensitivities for other sensory modalities.

NMDARs are always assembled in tetrameric form, in which two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 and/or GluN3 subunits combine together. Previous studies focused mainly on the hippocampus. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key cortical region for sensory and emotional functions. NMDAR GluN2A and GluN2B subunits have been previously investigated, however much less is known about the GluN2C/2D subunits.ResultsIn the present study, we found that the GluN2C/2D subunits are expressed in the pyramidal cells of ACC of adult mice. Application of a selective antagonist of GluN2C/2D, (2R*,3S*)-1-(9-bromophenanthrene-3-carbonyl) piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (UBP145), significantly reduced NMDAR-mediated currents, while synaptically evoked EPSCs were not affected. UBP145 affected neither the postsynaptic long-term potentiation (post-LTP) nor the presynaptic LTP (pre-LTP). Furthermore, the long-term depression (LTD) was also not affected by UBP145. Finally, both UBP145 decreased the frequency of the miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) while the amplitude remained intact, suggesting that the GluN2C/2D may be involved in presynaptic regulation of spontaneous glutamate release.ConclusionsOur results provide direct evidence that the GluN2C/2D contributes to evoked NMDAR mediated currents and mEPSCs in the ACC, which may have significant physiological implications.","NMDAR, GluN2C/2D, ACC, LTP, LTD",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00744-3,2021

Although aggregate-interacting proteins have been considered to modulate the formation of aggregates and to be involved in molecular mechanisms of disease progression, the components of aggregate-interacting proteins remain unknown. In this study, we showed that small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alfa (SGTA) is an aggregate-interacting protein in neurodegenerative diseases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SGTA interacted with intracellular aggregates in Huntington disease (HD) cell models and neurons of HD model mice. We also revealed that SGTA colocalized with intracellular aggregates in postmortem brains of patients with polyQ diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA3, and dentatorubral–pallidoluysian atrophy. In addition, SGTA colocalized with glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the brains of MSA patients, whereas no accumulation of SGTA was observed in neurons of PD and ALS patients.

PRKN is known to be involved with various mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control including mitochondrial structural changes. Parkinson’s disease (PD) with PRKN mutations is characterized by the preferential degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which has been suggested to result from the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. However, ultrastructural changes of mitochondria specifically in dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSC have rarely been analyzed. The main reason for this would be that the dopaminergic neurons cannot be distinguished directly among a mixture of iPSC-derived differentiated cells under electron microscopy. To selectively label dopaminergic neurons and analyze mitochondrial morphology at the ultrastructural level, we generated control and PRKN-mutated patient tyrosine hydroxylase reporter (TH-GFP) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Correlative light-electron microscopy analysis and live cell imaging of GFP-expressing dopaminergic neurons indicated that iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons had smaller and less functional mitochondria than those in non-dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the formation of spheroid-shaped mitochondria, which was induced in control dopaminergic neurons by a mitochondrial uncoupler, was inhibited in the PRKN-mutated dopaminergic neurons. These results indicate that our established TH-GFP iPSC lines are useful for characterizing mitochondrial morphology, such as spheroid-shaped mitochondria, in dopaminergic neurons among a mixture of various cell types. Our in vitro model would provide insights into the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons and the processes leading to the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in patients with PRKN mutations.","Mitochondria, Ultrastructure, PRKN, IPSC, Dopaminergic neurons",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00771-0,2021

Recent studies have suggested that the oxytocin system, which regulates social behavior in mammals, is potentially involved in ASD. Mouse models of ASD provide a useful system for understanding the associations between an impaired oxytocin system and social behavior deficits. However, limited studies have shown the involvement of the oxytocin system in the behavioral phenotypes in mouse models of ASD. We have previously demonstrated that a mouse model that carries the ASD patient-derived de novo mutation in the pogo transposable element derived with zinc finger domain (POGZWT/Q1038R mice), showed ASD-like social behavioral deficits. Here, we have explored whether oxytocin (OXT) administration improves impaired social behavior in POGZWT/Q1038R mice and found that intranasal oxytocin administration effectively restored the impaired social behavior in POGZWT/Q1038R mice. We also found that the expression level of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) was low in POGZWT/Q1038R mice. However, we did not detect significant changes in the number of OXT-expressing neurons between the paraventricular nucleus of POGZWT/Q1038R mice and that of WT mice. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that POGZ binds to the promoter region of OXTR and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of OXTR.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we find that NAP1 directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of human TMEM132D, and mutations in C. elegans tmem-132 that disrupt interaction with NAP1 cause similar morphologic defects in the PDE neurons. NAP1 is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) that controls F-actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Decreasing activity of WRC rescues the PDE defects in tmem-132 mutants, whereas gain-of-function of TMEM132D in mammalian cells inhibits WRC, leading to decreased abundance of select WRC components, impaired actin nucleation and cell motility.

Notably, neurons rescued by triple mutants of Cav1 lacking palmitoylation sites mutants show impairments in both synaptic transmission and retrieval.

We recently found that NHE6 directly interacts with secretory carrier membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5), and SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 to SVs controls the strength of synaptic transmission by modulation of quantal size of glutamate release at rest. It is, however, unknown whether NHE6 recruitment by SCAMP5 plays a role during synaptic plasticity. Here, we found that the number of NHE6-positive presynaptic boutons was significantly increased by the chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). Since cLTP involves new synapse formation, our results indicated that NHE6 was recruited not only to the existing presynaptic boutons but also to the newly formed presynaptic boutons. Knock down of SCAMP5 completely abrogated the enhancement of NHE6 recruitment by cLTP. Interestingly, despite an increase in the number of NHE6-positive boutons by cLTP, the quantal size of glutamate release at the presynaptic terminals remained unaltered. Together with our recent results, our findings indicate that SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 plays a critical role in manifesting presynaptic efficacy not only at rest but also during synaptic plasticity. Since both are autism candidate genes, reduced presynaptic efficacy by interfering with their interaction may underlie the molecular mechanism of synaptic dysfunction observed in autism.","NHE6, SCAMP5, cLTP, Presynaptic terminal, Activity-dependent synaptic localization, Synaptic vesicle, Presynaptic quantal size, Autism",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00763-0,2021

Specifically, the projection from the prelimbic cortex (PL) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to regulate sensory and affective aspects of pain in a number of rodent models. Previous studies have shown that enhancement of glutamate signaling through the NAc by AMPAkines, a class of agents that specifically potentiate the function of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, reduces acute and persistent pain. However, it is not known whether postsynaptic potentiation of the NAc with these agents can achieve the full anti-nociceptive effects of PL activation. Here we compared the impact of AMPAkine treatment in the NAc with optogenetic activation of the PL on pain behaviors in rats. We found that not only does AMPAkine treatment partially reconstitute the PL inhibition of sensory withdrawals, it fully occludes the effect of the PL on reducing the aversive component of pain. These results indicate that the NAc is likely one of the key targets for the PL, especially in the regulation of pain aversion. Furthermore, our results lend support for neuromodulation or pharmacological activation of the corticostriatal circuit as an important analgesic approach.","Prelimbic cortex, Nucleus accumbens, AMPAkine, CX 546, Pain",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00757-y,2021

However, it remains unclear how these regions interact to reconsolidate/enhance IA memory. Here, we found the interactions between the amygdala and mPFC as upstream regulators of the hippocampus for IA memory reconsolidation. Pharmacological inactivation of the amygdala, mPFC, or hippocampus immediately after IA memory retrieval blocked IA memory enhancement. More importantly, inactivation of the amygdala or mPFC blocked the induction of c-Fos in the amygdala, mPFC, and hippocampus, whereas hippocampal blockade inhibited it only in the hippocampus. These observations suggest interactions between the amygdala and mPFC and they both function as upstream regulators of the hippocampus to reconsolidate IA memory.

This antioxidant enzyme is expressed throughout the brain, including the hippocampus. Recent evidence reveals that PRDX6 plays an important role in redox regulation and the modulation of several signaling molecules involved in fear regulation. Thus, we hypothesized that PRDX6 plays a role in the regulation of fear memory. We subjected a systemic Prdx6 knockout (Prdx6−/−) mice to trace fear conditioning and observed enhanced fear response after training. Intraventricular injection of lentivirus-carried mouse Prdx6 into the 3rd ventricle reduced the enhanced fear response in these knockout mice. Proteomic analysis followed by validation of western blot analysis revealed that several proteins in the MAPK pathway, such as NTRK2, AKT, and phospho-ERK1/2, cPLA2 were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of Prdx6−/− mice during the retrieval stage of contextual fear memory. The distribution of PRDX6 found in the astrocytes was also observed throughout the hippocampus. This study identifies PRDX6 as a participant in the regulation of fear response.

The simvastatin administration causes a deficiency in recognition and spatial memory but fails to affect motor ability and anxiety behaviors in the mice. Mass spectrometry imaging indicates a significant decrease in cholesterol intensity in hippocampus of the mice receiving chronic simvastatin treatments. Such effects of simvastatin are transient because drug discontinuation can restore the hippocampal cholesterol level and synaptic plasticity and the memory function.

In this study, we investigated the effects of experience with a battery of behavioral tests, the wall color of the closed arms, and illumination level on the behavior and plasma corticosterone responses in the elevated plus maze in male C57BL/6J mice. Mice were either subjected to a series of behavioral tests, including assessments of general health and neurological function, a light/dark transition test, and an open field test, or left undisturbed until the start of the elevated plus maze test. The mice with and without test battery experience were allowed to freely explore the elevated plus maze. The other two independent groups of naïve mice were tested in mazes with closed arms with different wall colors (clear, transparent blue, white, and black) or different illumination levels (5, 100, and 800 lx). Immediately after the test, blood was collected to measure plasma corticosterone concentrations. Mice with test battery experience showed a lower percentage of open arm time and entries and, somewhat paradoxically, had lower plasma corticosterone levels than the mice with no test battery experience. Mice tested in the maze with closed arms with clear walls exhibited higher open arm exploration than mice tested in the maze with closed arms with black walls, while there were no significant differences in plasma corticosterone levels between the different wall color conditions. Illumination levels had no significant effects on any measure. Our results indicate that experience with other behavioral tests and different physical features of the maze affect elevated plus maze behaviors. Increased open arm time and entries are conventionally interpreted as decreased anxiety-like behavior, while other possible interpretations are considered: open arm exploration may reflect heightened anxiety and panic-like reaction to a novel situation under certain conditions. With the possibility of different interpretations, the present findings highlight the need to carefully consider the test conditions in designing experiments and drawing conclusions from the behavioral outcomes in the elevated plus maze test in C57BL/6J mice.","Elevated plus maze, Open arm exploration, Anxiety-like behavior, Plasma corticosterone, C57BL/6J mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00721-2,2021

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the mGAD65 promoter preferentially transduced parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. Notably, the mGAD65 promoter transduced chandelier cells more efficiently than the mDlx enhancer and robustly labeled their synaptic boutons, called the cartridge, targeting the axon initial segments of excitatory pyramidal neurons. To test the ability of the mGAD65 promoter to express a functional molecule, we virally expressed G-CaMP, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, in the motor cortex, and this enabled us to monitor spontaneous and drug-induced Ca2+ activity in GABAergic inhibitory neurons.

However, the resultant averaged values do not lead to understanding of neural computation in which the responses of populations are highly variable even under identical external conditions. Accordingly, neural interactions within the population also show strong fluctuations. In the present study, we introduce an analysis method reflecting the temporal variation of neural interactions, in which cross-correlograms on rate estimates are applied via a latent dynamical systems model. Using this method, we were able to predict time-varying neural interactions within a single trial. In addition, the pairwise connections estimated in our analysis increased along behavioral epochs among neurons categorized within similar functional groups. Thus, our analysis method revealed that neurons in the same groups communicate more as the population gets involved in the assigned task. We also showed that the characteristics of neural interaction from our model differ from the results of a typical model employing cross-correlation coefficients.

As hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons are known to consolidate contextual fear memory, we analyzed real-time changes in metabolites in the dentate gyrus in different sleep–wake states in mice. Throughout the study, we consistently detected more than > 200 metabolites. Metabolite profiles changed dramactically upon sleep–wake state transitions, leading to a clear separation of phenotypes between wakefulness and sleep. By contrast, contextual fear memory consolidation induced less obvious metabolite phenotypes. However, changes in purine metabolites were observed upon both sleep–wake state transitions and contextual fear memory consolidation. Dietary supplementation of certain purine metabolites impaired correlations between conditioned fear responses before and after memory consolidation. These results point toward the importance of purine metabolism in fear memory processing during sleep.","Fear memory, REM sleep, Non-REM sleep, Dentate gyrus, Hippocampus, Metabolomics, Purine metabolism",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00733-6,2021

The use of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in human complex traits has been recently proposed. However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence. The standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for the primary MR analysis and three additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO) were used for sensitivity analyses. Using 25 genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), our study found that 5-oxoproline was associated with better performance in human intelligence tests (PIVW = 9.25 × 10–5). The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were applied (PMR-Egger = 0.0001, PWeighted median = 6.29 × 10–6, PMR-PRESSO = 0.0007), and repeated analysis yielded consistent result (PIVW = 0.0087). Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence. Our study provides novel insight by integrating genomics and metabolomics to estimate causal effects of genetically determined metabolites on human intelligence, which help to understanding of the biological mechanisms related to human intelligence.","Genetically determined metabolite, Human intelligence, Mendelian randomization, Metabolic pathway, 5-Oxoproline",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00743-4,2021

Treatment for 14 days with PEA-OXA after the onset of the symptoms associated with neuropathic pain resulted in the following effects: (i) allodynia was decreased; (ii) affective/cognitive impairment associated with SNI (depression, spatial, and working memories) was counteracted; (iii) long-term potentiation in vivo in the lateral entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus (perforant pathway, LPP) was ameliorated, (iv) hippocampal glutamate, GABA, histamine, norepinephrine and dopamine altered levels after peripheral nerve injury were reversed, (v) expression level of the TH positive neurons in the Locus Coeruleus were normalized.

Firstly, we compared the effects of the order in which we delivered a strong theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol (75 pulses) and a weak TBS protocol (15 pulses) to two independent inputs. We only observed significant heterosynaptic metaplasticity when the strong TBS preceded the weak TBS. Second, we found that pausing stimulation following either the sTBS or the wTBS for ~20 min largely eliminates the heterosynaptic metaplasticity. These observations are consistent with a process that is triggered by the synaptic insertion of CP-AMPARs and provide a framework for establishing the underlying molecular mechanisms.","Synaptic tag and capture, Synapse specificity, Synaptic efficacy, Synaptic potentiation, Heterosynaptic plasticity, Metaplasticity, Learning, Memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00737-2,2021

Previously, RNA analysis was widely used to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TBI; however, the relatively low correlation between the transcriptome and proteome revealed that RNA transcription abundance does not reliably predict protein abundance, which led to the emergence of proteomic research. In this study, an iTRAQ proteomics approach was applied to detect protein alterations after TBI on a large scale. A total of 3937 proteins were identified, and 146 proteins were significantly changed after TBI. Moreover, 23 upregulated proteins were verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), and fold changes in 16 proteins were consistent with iTRAQ outcomes. Transthyretin (Ttr) upregulation has been demonstrated at the transcriptional level, and this study further confirmed this at the protein level. After treatment with thyroxine (T4), which is transported by Ttr, the effects of T4 on neuronal histopathology and behavioral performance were determined in vivo (TBI + T4 group). Brain edema was alleviated, and the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) improved. Escape latency in the Morris water maze (MWM) declined significantly compared with the group without T4 treatment. Modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) of the TBI + T4 group decreased from day 1 to day 7 post-TBI compared with the TBI + saline group. These results indicate that T4 treatment has potential to alleviate pathologic and behavioral abnormalities post-TBI. Protein alterations after T4 treatment were also detected by iTRAQ proteomics. Upregulation of proteins like Lgals3, Gfap and Apoe after TBI were reversed by T4 treatment. GO enrichment showed T4 mainly affected intermediate filament organization, cholesterol transportation and axonal regeneration. In summary, iTRAQ proteomics provides information about the impact of TBI on protein alterations and yields insight into underlying mechanisms and pathways involved in TBI and T4 treatment. Finally, Ttr and other proteins identified by iTRAQ may become potential novel treatment targets post-TBI.","Traumatic brain injury, Quantitative proteomics, Mass spectrometry (MS), Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), Thyroxine, Transthyretin, Rat cortex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00739-0,2021

To assess the physiological significance of the initial N-cadherin cleavage, we engineer the mouse genome to create a knock-in allele with tandem missense mutations in the mouse N-cadherin/Cadherin-2 gene (Cdh2 R714G, I715D, or GD) that confers resistance on proteolysis by ADAM10 (GD mice). GD mice showed a better performance in the radial maze test, with significantly less revisiting errors after intervals of 30 and 300 s than WT, and a tendency for enhanced freezing in fear conditioning. Interestingly, GD mice reveal higher complexity in the tufts of thorny excrescence in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Fine morphometry with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction reveals significantly higher synaptic density, significantly smaller PSD area, and normal dendritic spine volume in GD mice. This knock-in mouse has provided in vivo evidence that ADAM10-mediated cleavage is a critical step in N-cadherin shedding and degradation and involved in the structure and function of glutamatergic synapses, which affect the memory function.","N-cadherin, ADAM10, Synapse, Hippocampus, Working memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00738-1,2021

Functional expression of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is under the control of SUMOylated collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). When not SUMOylated, CRMP2 forms a complex with the endocytic proteins Numb, the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 (Eps15), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NaV1.7.

In this study, we investigated the genetic background of a large Dutch family with autosomal dominant‒inherited WC that was negative for mutations in known dystonia genes. Whole exome sequencing identified 4 rare variants of unknown significance that segregated in the family. One candidate gene was selected for follow-up, Calcium Voltage-Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 H, CACNA1H, due to its links with the known dystonia gene Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain Containing 17, KCTD17, and with paroxysmal movement disorders. Targeted resequencing of CACNA1H in 82 WC cases identified another rare, putative damaging variant in a familial WC case that did not segregate. Using structural modelling and functional studies in vitro, we show that both the segregating p.Arg481Cys variant and the non-segregating p.Glu1881Lys variant very likely cause structural changes to the Cav3.2 protein and lead to similar gains of function, as seen in an accelerated recovery from inactivation. Both mutant channels are thus available for re-activation earlier, which may lead to an increase in intracellular calcium and increased neuronal excitability. Overall, we conclude that rare functional variants in CACNA1H need to be interpreted very carefully, and additional studies are needed to prove that the p.Arg481Cys variant is the cause of WC in the large Dutch family.","Writer’s cramp, Focal dystonia, CACNA1H, Rare variants, Structural and functional analysis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00736-3,2021

To understand the mechanisms behind the deficits of lysosomal GCase enzyme activity in idiopathic PD, this study utilized a large cohort of fibroblast cells from control subjects and PD patients with and without mutations in the GBA gene (N370S mutation) (control, n = 15; idiopathic PD, n = 31; PD with GBA N370S mutation, n = 6). The current data demonstrates that idiopathic PD fibroblasts devoid of any mutations in the GBA gene also exhibit reduction in lysosomal GCase activity, similar to those with the GBA N370S mutation. This reduced GCase enzyme activity in idiopathic PD cells was accompanied by decreased expression of the GBA trafficking receptor, LIMP2, and increased ER retention of the GBA protein in these cells. Importantly, in idiopathic PD fibroblasts LIMP2 protein levels correlated significantly with GCase activity, which was not the case in control subjects or in genetic PD GBA N370S cells. In conclusion, idiopathic PD fibroblasts have  decreased GCase activity primarily driven by altered LIMP2-mediated transport of GBA to lysosome and the reduced GCase activity exhibited by  the genetic GBA N370S derived PD fibroblasts  occurs through a different mechanism.","GBA, LIMP2, Idiopathic PD fibroblasts, Lysosomal dysfunction",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00712-3,2021

Compared to the naïve mice, a significant increase in itch-related behaviors was observed in the CCD mice after the injection of pruritogens including histamine and BAM8-22, but not after the injection of capsaicin, although all the above agents evoked enhanced pain-related behaviors toward the injected site. In addition, we investigated if pruritogen-evoked activities of DRG neurons were enhanced in this model. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that compressed DRG neurons exhibited enhanced responses to histamine and BAM8-22. Immunoflorescent staining also showed that the histamine receptor H1 and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 were significantly upregulated in DRG neurons. Our findings indicated that the sensitization of primary pruriceptive neurons may underlie the enhanced itch sensation after chronic compression of DRG in the mice, and may play a role in chronic pruritus in neurological diseases.","DRG compression, Pruriceptor, Itch, Hyperkinesis, Behavior",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00730-9,2021

Elaborate transport machinery including motor complexes is required to deliver and localize mitochondria to appropriate positions. Defects in mitochondrial transport are associated with various neurological disorders without a detailed mechanistic information. In this study, we present evidence that dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (dysbindin), a schizophrenia-associated factor, plays a critical role in axonal mitochondrial movement. We observed that mitochondrial movement was impaired in dysbindin knockout mouse neurons. Reduced mitochondrial motility caused by dysbindin deficiency decreased the density of mitochondria in the distal part of axons. Moreover, the transport and distribution of mitochondria were regulated by the association between dysbindin and p150glued. Furthermore, altered mitochondrial distribution in axons led to disrupted calcium dynamics, showing abnormal calcium influx in presynaptic terminals. These data collectively suggest that dysbindin forms a functional complex with p150glued that regulates axonal mitochondrial transport, thereby affecting presynaptic calcium homeostasis.","Mitochondrial movement, Calcium homeostasis, Dysbindin, p150glued, Dynactin complex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00720-3,2021

However, it remains poorly understood what integrative strategies are employed by the brain to deal with different task contexts. To explore it, we examined neural activities of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing cue-guided two-alternative forced-choice tasks. In a task requiring rats to discriminate stimuli based on auditory cue, the simultaneous presentation of an uninformative visual cue substantially strengthened mPFC neurons' capability of auditory discrimination mainly through enhancing the response to the preferred cue. Doing this also increased the number of neurons revealing a cue preference. If the task was changed slightly and a visual cue, like the auditory, denoted a specific behavioral direction, mPFC neurons frequently showed a different CMI pattern with an effect of cross-modal enhancement best evoked in information-congruent multisensory trials. In a choice free task, however, the majority of neurons failed to show a cross-modal enhancement effect and cue preference. These results indicate that CMI at the neuronal level is context-dependent in a way that differs from what has been shown in previous studies.","Behavioral training, Cross-modal interaction, Decision making, Medial prefrontal cortex, Multisensory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00732-7,2021

Among the top genetic associations, zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene encodes a zinc finger protein, associated with SZ and biolar disorder (BD). Copy number variants (CNVs) of ZNF804A have been observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), anxiety disorder, and BD, suggesting that ZNF804A is a dosage sensitive gene for brain development. However, its molecular functions have not been fully determined. Our previous interactomic study revealed that ZNF804A interacts with multiple proteins to control protein translation and neural development. ZNF804A is localized in the cytoplasm and neurites in the human cortex and is expressed in various types of neurons, including pyramidal, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and Purkinje neurons in mouse brain. To further examine the effect of gene dosage of ZNF804A on neurite morphology, both knockdown and overexpression of ZNF804A in primary neuronal cells significantly attenuate dendritic complex and spine formation. To determine the factors mediating these phenotypes, interestingly, three binding proteins of ZNF804A, galectin 1 (LGALS1), fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) and ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), show different effects on reversing the deficits. LGALS1 and FEZ1 stimulate neurite outgrowth at basal level but RPSA shows no effect. Intriguingly, LGALS1 but not FEZ1, reverses the neurite outgrowth deficits induced by ZNF804A knockdown. However, FEZ1 and RPSA but not LGALS1, can ameliorate ZNF804A overexpression-mediated dendritic abnormalities. Thus, our results uncover a critical post-mitotic role of ZNF804A in neurite and synaptic development relevant to neurodevelopmental pathologies.","Schizophrenia, ZNF804A, ZNF804A binding proteins, Dendritic morphology",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-021-00729-2,2021

Stressful experiences in early life are considered one of the risk factors for chronic depressive symptoms, along with an abnormal inflammatory response in later life. Although increased inflammatory activity has been identified in patients with depression, the cause of long-lasting depressive states is still unclear. To identify the effects of cumulative mild stress in brain development periods, we generated a young adult depression mouse model exposed to cumulative mild stress (CPMS; cumulative mild prenatal stress, mild maternal separation, and mild social defeat) to mimic early life adversities. CPMS mice exhibited more long-lasting anxiety and depression-like behaviors than groups exposed to single or double combinations of mild stress in young adult age. Using the molecular works, we found that inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-17, upregulated microglial activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex of CPMS mice. In the brains of CPMS mice, we also identified changes in the T helper (Th)-17 cell population as well as differentiation. Finally, anti-IL-17 treatment rescued anxiety and depression-like behavior in CPMS mice. In conclusion, we found that cumulative mild stress promoted long-lasting depressive symptoms in CPMS mice through the upregulation of IL-17. We suggest that the CPMS model may be useful to study young adult depression and expect that IL-17 may be an important therapeutic target for depression in young adults.","Cumulative mild stress, Brain development, Young adulthood, Depression-like behavior, Anxiety, Inflammation, Interleukin-17",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00726-x,2021

Each BDNF transcript is composed by one out of 11 alternatively spliced exons containing the 5′untranslated region (UTR), and one common exon encompassing the coding sequence (CDS) and the 3′UTR with two variants (short and long). In neurons, BDNF mRNA variants have a distinct subcellular distribution, constituting a “spatial code”, with exon 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 located in neuronal somata, exon 4 extending into proximal dendrites, and exon 2 and 6 reaching distal dendrites. We previously showed that the CDS encodes constitutive dendritic targeting signals (DTS) and that both the 3′UTR-short and the 3′UTR-long contain activity-dependent DTS. However, the role of individual 5′UTR exons in mRNA sorting remains unclear. Here, we tested the ability of each different BDNF 5′UTRs to affect the subcellular localization of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mRNA. We found that exon 2 splicing isoforms (2a, 2b, and 2c) induced a constitutive dendritic targeting of the GFP reporter mRNA towards distal dendritic segments. The other isoforms did not affect GFP-mRNA dendritic trafficking. Through a bioinformatic analysis, we identified five unique cis-elements in exon 2a, 2b, and 2c which might contribute to building a DTS.

N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP and LTD play especially crucial roles in these functions, and their expression depends on changes in the number and single channel conductance of the major ionotropic glutamate receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) located on the postsynaptic membrane. Structural changes in dendritic spines comprise the morphological platform and support for molecular changes in the execution of synaptic plasticity and memory storage. At the molecular level, spine morphology is directly determined by actin cytoskeleton organization within the spine and indirectly stabilized and consolidated by scaffold proteins at the spine head. Palmitoylation, as a uniquely reversible lipid modification with the ability to regulate protein membrane localization and trafficking, plays significant roles in the structural and functional regulation of LTP and LTD. Altered structural plasticity of dendritic spines is also considered a hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders, while genetic evidence strongly links abnormal brain function to impaired palmitoylation. Numerous studies have indicated that palmitoylation contributes to morphological spine modifications. In this review, we have gathered data showing that the regulatory proteins that modulate the actin network and scaffold proteins related to AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission also undergo palmitoylation and play roles in modifying spine architecture during structural plasticity.","Lipid posttranslational modification, Long term potentiation (LTP), Long term depression (LTD), Structural plasticity, AMPAR, Actin cytoskeleton, Rho GTPases",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00717-y,2021

However, the underlying neuronal network involved in this test has yet to be studied. The purpose of this study was to identify the principal brain regions activated in the OBAT. Accordingly, C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the OBAT and thereafter prepared for immunohistochemical quantification of c-Fos, an immediate early gene that is frequently used as a marker of neuronal activity, in 13 different brain regions. The number of c-Fos-positive cells was significantly higher in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and dentate gyrus (DG) in the test group as compared to the control group. The neuronal activation of these brain regions during the OBAT indicates that these brain regions are necessary for the regulation of attention in this test. This was supported by excitotoxic lesioning of these brain regions, leading to impaired attention without causing locomotor dysfunction. This study is one of the first attempts to analyze the brain regions that regulate attention in the OBAT. These findings provide an initial insight into the role of these brain regions and ideas for studying the underlying neural and molecular mechanisms.","Prefrontal cortex, Striatum, Dentate gyrus, Attention, OBAT, c-Fos, Lesion",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00711-4,2020

Neuronal MHC class I (MHCI), such as H-2D, regulate neurite outgrowth, the establishment and function of cortical connections, and activity-dependent refinement in mice. We previously established mice expressing MHCI specifically in astrocytes of the media prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector under the control of the GfaABC1D promoter. Mice expressing the soluble form of H-2D (sH-2D) in the mPFC (sH-2D-expressing mice) showed abnormal behaviors, including social interaction deficits and cognitive dysfunctions. However, the pathophysiological significance of astroglial MHCI on higher brain functions, such as learning, memory, and behavioral flexibility, remains unclear. Therefore, cognitive function in mice expressing sH-2D in astrocytes of the mPFC was tested using the visual discrimination (VD) task.MethodssH-2D-expressing mice were subjected to the VD and reversal learning tasks, and morphological analysis.ResultsIn the pretraining, sH-2D-expressing mice required significantly more trials to reach the learning criterion than control mice. The total number of sessions, trials, normal trials, and correction trials to reach the VD criterion were also significantly higher in sH-2D-expressing mice than in control mice. A morphological study showed that dendritic complexity and spine density were significantly reduced in the dorsal striatum of sH-2D-expressing mice.ConclusionCollectively, the present results suggest that the overexpression of astroglial MHCI in the mPFC results in impaired VD learning, which may be accompanied by decreased dendritic complexity in the dorsal striatum and mPFC.","MHCI, Astrocyte, Touchscreen, Visual discrimination, Reversal learning, Learning and memory, Cognition, Recognition memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00710-5,2020

One form of SGM is aneuploidy—the gain and/or loss of chromosomes—which is associated with mitotic spindle defects. The mitotic spindle orientation determines cleavage plane positioning and, therefore, neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate during cerebral cortical development. Here we report receptor-mediated signaling by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a novel extracellular signal that influences cleavage plane orientation and produces alterations in SGM by inducing aneuploidy during murine cortical neurogenesis. LPA is a bioactive lipid whose actions are mediated by six G protein-coupled receptors, LPA1–LPA6. RNAscope and qPCR assessment of all six LPA receptor genes, and exogenous LPA exposure in LPA receptor (Lpar)-null mice, revealed involvement of Lpar1 and Lpar2 in the orientation of the mitotic spindle. Lpar1 signaling increased non-vertical cleavage in vivo by disrupting cell–cell adhesion, leading to breakdown of the ependymal cell layer. In addition, genomic alterations were significantly increased after LPA exposure, through production of chromosomal aneuploidy in NPCs. These results identify LPA as a receptor-mediated signal that alters both NPC fate and genomes during cortical neurogenesis, thus representing an extracellular signaling mechanism that can produce stable genomic changes in NPCs and their progeny. Normal LPA signaling in early life could therefore influence both the developing and adult brain, whereas its pathological disruption could contribute to a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases, via long-lasting somatic genomic alterations.","LPA, Lysophospholipid, GPCR, Neural progenitor cells, NPC, Adherens junctions, Somatic genomic mosaicism, Aneuploidy, Cleavage plane, Hydrocephalus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00709-y,2020

Across various human brain regions, basal dendritic complexity is known to increase along a caudal-to-rostral gradient. We recently discovered that basal dendritic complexity of layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons in the mouse increases along a caudomedial-to-rostrolateral gradient spanning multiple regions, but at the time, no molecules were known to regulate that exquisite pattern. Integrin subunits have been implicated in dendritic development, and the subunit with the strongest associations with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability is integrin β3 (Itgb3). In mice, global knockout of Itgb3 leads to autistic-like neuroanatomy and behavior. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Itgb3 is required for increasing dendritic complexity along the recently discovered tangential gradient among layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons. We targeted a subset of layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons for Itgb3 loss-of-function via Cre-loxP-mediated excision of Itgb3. We tracked the rostrocaudal and mediolateral position of the targeted neurons and reconstructed their dendritic arbors. In contrast to controls, the basal dendritic complexity of Itgb3 mutant neurons was not related to their cortical position. Basal dendritic complexity of mutant and control neurons differed because of overall changes in branch number across multiple branch orders (primary, secondary, etc.), rather than any changes in the average length at those branch orders. Furthermore, dendritic spine density was related to cortical position in control but not mutant neurons. Thus, the autism susceptibility gene Itgb3 is required for establishing a tangential pattern of basal dendritic complexity among layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons, suggesting an early role for this molecule in the developing brain.","Integrin beta 3, Integrin β3, Itgb3, Dendritic complexity, Dendrite, Pyramidal neuron, Dendritogenesis, Autism, In utero electroporation, Mosaic analysis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00707-0,2020

Sleep deprivation induces significant changes in gene transcription in many brain regions, with the hippocampus particularly susceptible to acute sleep deprivation. However, less is known about the impacts of sleep deprivation on post-transcriptional gene regulation. To identify the effects of sleep deprivation on the translatome, we took advantage of the RiboTag mouse line to express HA-labeled Rpl22 in CaMKIIα neurons to selectively isolate and sequence mRNA transcripts associated with ribosomes in excitatory neurons. We found 198 differentially expressed genes in the ribosome-associated mRNA subset after sleep deprivation. In comparison with previously published data on gene expression in the hippocampus after sleep deprivation, we found that the subset of genes affected by sleep deprivation was considerably different in the translatome compared with the transcriptome, with only 49 genes regulated similarly. Interestingly, we found 478 genes differentially regulated by sleep deprivation in the transcriptome that were not significantly regulated in the translatome of excitatory neurons. Conversely, there were 149 genes differentially regulated by sleep deprivation in the translatome but not in the whole transcriptome. Pathway analysis revealed differences in the biological functions of genes exclusively regulated in the transcriptome or translatome, with protein deacetylase activity and small GTPase binding regulated in the transcriptome and unfolded protein binding, kinase inhibitor activity, neurotransmitter receptors and circadian rhythms regulated in the translatome. These results indicate that sleep deprivation induces significant changes affecting the pool of actively translated mRNAs.","Sleep deprivation, Ribosome, Memory, Hippocampus, TRAP, RNA, Gene expression",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00702-5,2020

Next, HPLC was used to determine dopamine levels, along with levels of its two metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the striatum.

Patients with SCA42 exhibit a pure form of cerebellar ataxia. We encountered a patient with the p.Arg1715His mutation, suffering from intractable resting tremor, particularly head tremor. This symptom improved with the administration of low-dose of zonisamide (ZNS), a T-type calcium channel blocker effective for treating Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. Previous electrophysiological studies showed that the voltage dependence of this mutant CaV3.1 was shifted toward the positive potential. This abnormal shift was considered a factor related to disease onset and symptoms. In this study, we performed whole-cell recordings of GFP-expressing HEK293T cells that expressed wild-type or mutant CaV3.1 and investigated the changes in the abnormal shift of voltage dependence of the mutant CaV3.1. The results showed that ZNS in an amount equivalent to the patient’s internal dose significantly ameliorated the abnormal shift in the mutant CaV3.1, giving values close to those in the wild-type. On the other hand, ZNS did not affect the voltage dependence of wild-type CaV3.1. Because CaV3.1 is known to be involved in tremogenesis, modulation of the voltage dependence of mutant CaV3.1 by ZNS might have contributed to improvement in the intractable tremor of our patient with SCA42. Moreover, efonidipine, another T-type calcium channel blocker, had no effect on tremors in our patient with SCA42 and did not improve the abnormal shift in the voltage dependence of the mutant CaV3.1. This indicates that ZNS is distinct from other T-type calcium channel blockers in terms of modulation of the voltage dependence of the mutant CaV3.1.","Spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA42, CACNA1G, T-type calcium channel, CaV3.1, Tremor, Zonisamide",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00700-7,2020

The modulation of the neuronal transcriptome in response to learning depends on transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. DNA methylation writers and readers regulate the activity-dependent genomic program required for memory consolidation. The most abundant DNA methylation reader, the Methyl CpG binding domain protein 2 (MeCP2), has been shown to regulate alternative splicing, but whether it establishes splicing events important for memory consolidation has not been investigated. In this study, we identified the alternative splicing profile of the mouse hippocampus in basal conditions and after a spatial learning experience, and investigated the requirement of MeCP2 for these processes. We observed that spatial learning triggers a wide-range of alternative splicing events in transcripts associated with structural and functional remodeling and that virus-mediated knockdown of MeCP2 impairs learning-dependent post-transcriptional responses of mature hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we found that MeCP2 preferentially affected the splicing modalities intron retention and exon skipping and guided the alternative splicing of distinct set of genes in baseline conditions and after learning. Lastly, comparative analysis of the MeCP2-regulated transcriptome with the alternatively spliced mRNA pool, revealed that MeCP2 disruption alters the relative abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms without affecting the overall mRNA levels. Taken together, our findings reveal that adult hippocampal MeCP2 is required to finetune alternative splicing events in basal conditions, as well as in response to spatial learning. This study provides new insight into how MeCP2 regulates brain function, particularly cognitive abilities, and sheds light onto the pathophysiological mechanisms of Rett syndrome, that is characterized by intellectual disability and caused by mutations in the Mecp2 gene.","Alternative splicing, Adult brain, DNA methylation, Gene transcription, Rett syndrome, RNA sequencing",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00695-1,2020

The mechanism underlying the differential expression of Olig2 in MNs and oligodendrocytes remains unknown. Here, we report that activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling in pMN lineage cells abolished Olig2 expression coupled with a dramatic increase of Ngn2 expression.

Recent studies have identified correlations between altered retrotransposon expression and the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a subset of patients. The risk of an individual developing ALS is dependent on an interaction of genetic variants and subsequent modifiers during life. These modifiers could include environmental factors, which can lead to epigenetic and genomic changes, such as somatic mutations, occurring in the neuronal cells that degenerate as the disease develops. There are more than 1 million L1 copies in the human genome today, but only 80–100 L1 loci in the reference genome are considered to be retrotransposition-competent (RC) and an even smaller number of these RC-L1s loci are highly active. We hypothesise that RC-L1s could affect normal cellular function through their mutagenic potential conferred by their ability to retrotranspose in neuronal cells and through DNA damage caused by the endonuclease activity of the L1-encoded ORF2 protein. To investigate whether either an increase in the genomic burden of RC-L1s or epigenetic changes to RC-L1s altering their expression, could play a role in disease development, we chose a set of seven well characterised genomic RC-L1 loci that were reported earlier to be highly active in a cellular L1 retrotransposition reporter assay or serve as major source elements for germline and/or somatic retrotransposition events. Analysis of the insertion allele frequency of five polymorphic RC-L1s, out of the set of seven, for their presence or absence, did not identify an increased number individually or when combined in individuals with the disease. However, we did identify reduced levels of methylation of RC-L1s in the motor cortex of those individuals with both familial and sporadic ALS compared to control brains. The changes to the regulation of the loci encompassing these RC-L1s demonstrated tissue specificity and could be related to the disease process.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, LINE-1, Retrotransposition competent, Methylation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00694-2,2020

Rodent models that recapitulate aggressive Aβ and/or the pathology of neurofibrillary tangles are essential for AD research. Accordingly, non-invasive early detection systems in these animal models are required to evaluate the phenotypic changes, elucidate the mechanism of disease progression, and facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches. Although many behavioral tests efficiently reveal cognitive impairments at the later stage of the disease in AD models, it has been challenging to detect such impairments at the early stage. To address this issue, we subjected 4–6-month-old male AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F knock-in (App-KI) mice to touchscreen-based location discrimination (LD), different object–location paired-associate learning (dPAL), and reversal learning tests, and compared the results with those of the classical Morris water maze test. These tests are mainly dependent on the brain regions prone to Aβ accumulation at the earliest stages of the disease. At 4–6 months, considered to represent the early stage of disease when mice exhibit initial deposition of Aβ and slight gliosis, the classical Morris water maze test revealed no difference between groups, whereas touchscreen-based LD and dPAL tasks revealed significant impairments in task performance. Our report is the first to confirm that a systematic touchscreen-based behavioral test battery can sensitively detect the early stage of cognitive decline in an AD-linked App-KI mouse model.

Based on these findings, the recent cloning of the Sigma-2 receptor (σ2R) led us to investigate its potential role as a regulator of opioid analgesia and of pain hypersensitivity in σ2R knockout mice. In contrast to σ1R deficient mice, σ2R knockout mice developed mechanical allodynia following establishment of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, which was alleviated by the σ1R antagonist S1RA. The analgesic effects of morphine, [D-Ala, N-MePhe, Gly-ol]-encephalin (DAMGO) and β-endorphin increased in σ1R−/− mice and diminished in σ2R−/− mice. The analgesic effect of morphine was increased in σ2R−/− mice by treatment with S1RA.

Therefore, identifying signaling pathways interacting with translin/trax to support persistent synaptic plasticity is a translationally relevant goal.

We found that mice lacking translin/trax exhibited selective impairment in a form of persistent hippocampal plasticity, which requires postsynaptic protein kinase A (PKA) activity. In contrast, enduring forms of plasticity that are dependent on presynaptic PKA were unaffected. Furthermore, these mice did not display exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD), a hallmark of the FMRP KO mice. On the contrary, translin KO mice exhibited deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent LTD, a phenotype not observed in the FMRP knockouts.

In this study, using genetic approaches that enable cell-type and circuit-specific functional manipulation, we reveal an intrinsic potential of locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenergic (NAergic) neurons that project to the SDH to control acute and chronic itch. Activation and silencing of SDH-projecting LC-NAergic neurons reduced and enhanced scratching behavior, respectively, in models of histamine-dependent and -independent acute itch. Furthermore, in a model of chronic itch associated with contact dermatitis, repetitive scratching behavior was suppressed by the activation of the descending LC-NAergic pathway and by knocking out NA transporters specific to descending LC-NAergic neurons using a CRISPR-Cas9 system. Moreover, patch-clamp recording using spinal slices showed that noradrenaline facilitated inhibitory synaptic inputs onto gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing SDH neurons, a neuronal subset known to be essential for itch transmission.

The voltage-gated proton channel, Hv1, functionally expressed in microglia has been implicated in microglia polarization and oxidative stress in ischemic stroke.

Following contusion SCI, wild-type (WT) mice showed significant tissue damage, white matter damage and impaired motor recovery. However, mice lacking Hv1 (Hv1−/−) showed significant white matter sparing and improved motor recovery. The improved motor recovery in Hv1−/− mice was associated with decreased interleukin-1β, reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species production and reduced neuronal loss. Further, deficiency of Hv1 directly influenced microglia activation as noted by decrease in microglia numbers, soma size and reduced outward rectifier K+ current density in Hv1−/− mice compared to WT mice at 7 d following SCI.

The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1.

Furthermore, neuronal stimulation induces an increase in the number of CCV/CCP in presynaptic terminals, but a decrease in soma/dendrites. Immunogold labeling of clathrin revealed that in presynaptic terminals under resting conditions, the majority of clathrin molecules are unassembled and concentrated outside of synaptic vesicle clusters. Upon depolarization with high K+, label for clathrin became scattered among de-clustered synaptic vesicles and moved closer to the presynaptic active zone. In contrast to axons, clathrin-labeled CCVs and CCPs were prominent in soma/dendrites under resting conditions, and became inconspicuous upon depolarization with high K+. Thus, EM examination suggests that the regulation and mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis differ between axon and dendrite, and that clathrin redistributes differently in these two neuronal compartments upon depolarization.","Electron microscopy, Clathrin-coated vesicles, Clathrin-coated pits, Endocytosis, Synaptic vesicle, Multivesicular body, Glutamate receptors, Transferrin receptors",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00683-5,2020

Our previous study demonstrated that α2AP knockout mice exhibit spatial memory impairment in comparison to wild-type mice, suggesting that α2AP is necessary for the fetal and/or neonatal development of the neural network for spatial memory. However, it is still unclear whether α2AP plays a role in the memory process. The present study demonstrated that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and remote spatial memory were enhanced by the injection of an anti-α2AP neutralizing antibody in WT mice, while the injection of α2AP reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired remote spatial memory, suggesting that α2AP is a negative regulator in memory processing. The present study also found that the levels of α2AP in the brains of old mice were higher than those in young mice, and a negative correlation between the α2AP level and spatial working memory. In addition, aging-dependent brain oxidative stress and hippocampal inflammation were attenuated by α2AP deficiency. Thus, an age-related increase in α2AP might cause cognitive decline accompanied by brain oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Taken together, our findings suggest that α2AP is a key regulator of the spatial memory process, and that it may represent a promising target to effectively regulate healthy brain aging.","α2-Antiplasmin, Brain aging, Hippocampus, Neurogenesis, Plasmin, Spatial memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00677-3,2020

These findings suggest a common neuronal basis for depression and chronic pain. Recently, we reported that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system was tonically suppressed during chronic pain by enhanced inhibitory synaptic inputs to neurons projecting from the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), suggesting that tonic suppression of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system by this neuroplastic change may be involved in chronic pain-induced depression-like behaviors. In this study, we hypothesized that inhibitory synaptic inputs to VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons are also enhanced in animal models of depression, thereby suppressing the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. To test this hypothesis, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology using brain slices prepared from rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS), a widely used animal model of depression. The results showed a significant enhancement in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons in the CMS group compared with the no stress group. The findings revealed enhanced inhibitory synaptic inputs to VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons in this rat model of depression, suggesting that this neuroplastic change is a neuronal mechanism common to depression and chronic pain that causes dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, thereby inducing depression-like behaviors.","Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, Chronic mild stress, Chronic pain, Depression",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00684-4,2020

However, AAVs with these two advantages have not been reported. Here, we describe a new capsid engineering method, which exploits the combination of different capsids and aims to yield a capsid that can provide more alternative routes of administration that are more suitable for the wide-scale transduction of the central nervous system (CNS). A new AAV variant, AAV9-Retro, was developed by inserting the 10-mer peptide fragment from AAV2-Retro into the capsid of AAV9, and the biodistribution properties were evaluated in mice. By intracranial and intravenous injection in the mice, we found that AAV9-Retro can retrogradely infect projection neurons with an efficiency comparable to that of AAV2-Retro and retains the characteristic of AAV9, which can be transported across the nervous system.

Despite the recent emphasis on the importance of the intrinsic excitability related to learning and memory, the direct correlation between the intrinsic excitability of PCs and OKR learning has not been tested. In the present study, by utilizing the whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we compared the responses of cerebellar PCs to somatic current injection between the control and learned groups. We found that the neurons from the learned group showed a significant reduction in mean firing rate compared with neurons in the control group. In the analysis of single action potential (AP), we revealed that the rheobase current for the generation of single AP was increased by OKR learning, while AP threshold, AP amplitude, and afterhyperpolarization amplitude were not altered.

One possibility is the dysfunction of GABAergic transmission and ensuing excitotoxicity. Dysfunction of GABAergic transmission induces excitotoxicity, which contributes to stroke pathology, but the mechanism has kept unknown. The secreted leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family protein slit homologue 2 (Slit2) upregulates GABAergic activity and protects against global cerebral ischemia, but the neuroprotective efficacy of Slit2 against MIs has not been examined.MethodsMiddle-aged Wild type (WT) and Slit2-Tg mice were divided into sham and MI treatment groups. MIs were induced in parietal cortex by laser-evoked arteriole occlusion. Spatial memory was then compared between sham and MI groups using the Morris water maze (MWM) task. In addition, neuronal activity, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and glymphatic clearance in peri-infarct areas were compared using two-photon imaging, while GABAergic transmission, microglial activation, neuronal loss, and altered cortical connectivity were compared by immunofluorescent staining or western blotting.ResultsMicroinfarcts increased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ signals, reduced neuronal survival and connectivity within parietal cortex, decreased the number of GABAergic interneurons and expression of vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), induced neuroinflammation, and impaired both glymphatic clearance and spatial memory. Alternatively, Slit2 overexpression attenuated dysfunctional neuronal Ca2+ signaling, protected against neuronal death in the peri-infarct area as well as loss of parietal cortex connectivity, increased GABAergic interneuron number and VGAT expression, attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved both glymphatic clearance and spatial memory.ConclusionOur results strongly suggest that overexpression of Slit2 protected against the dysfunction in MIs, which is a potential therapeutic target for cognition impairment in the elderly.","Slit2, Microinfarcts, Two-photon imaging, Cognition, Glymphatic clearance",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00659-5,2020

CSF samples were collected from neonates with HIBD (n = 4) or controls (n = 4). ITRAQ LC–MS/MS was used to identify differentially expressed peptides between two groups. A total of 35 differentially expressed peptides from 25 precursor proteins were identified.

Results of bioinformatics analysis showed that HSP90α/HSP90AA1 was located in the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network hub and was involved in the NOD-LIKE receptor (NLR) signaling pathway.

Here we explored the functional coupling of the amygdala to spinal nociception. We found that pharmacological activation of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) increased the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons; and this effect was blocked by optogenetic silencing of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) positive CeA neurons. A kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist (U-69,593) was administered into the CeA by microdialysis. KOR was targeted because of their role in averse-affective behaviors through actions in limbic brain regions. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made of CeA neurons or spinal dorsal horn neurons in anesthetized transgenic Crh-Cre rats. Neurons responded more strongly to noxious than innocuous stimuli. U-69,593 increased the responses of CeA and spinal neurons to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation of peripheral tissues. The facilitatory effect of the agonist was blocked by optical silencing of CRF-CeA neurons though light activation of halorhodopsin expressed in these neurons by viral-vector. The CRF system in the amygdala has been implicated in aversiveness and pain modulation.

However, changes in metabolism at the cellular level, implicated in FTD and in neurodegeneration in general, are still poorly understood. Here we generate induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients carrying mutations in CHMP2B (FTD3) and isogenic controls generated via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing with subsequent neuronal and glial differentiation and characterization. FTD3 neurons show a dysregulation of glutamate-glutamine related metabolic pathways mapped by 13C-labelling coupled to mass spectrometry. FTD3 astrocytes show increased uptake of glutamate whilst glutamate metabolism is largely maintained. Using quantitative proteomics and live-cell metabolic analyses, we elucidate molecular determinants and functional alterations of neuronal and glial energy metabolism in FTD3. Importantly, correction of the mutations rescues such pathological phenotypes. Notably, these findings implicate dysregulation of key enzymes crucial for glutamate-glutamine homeostasis in FTD3 pathogenesis which may underlie vulnerability to neurodegeneration.Graphical abstractNeurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients carrying mutations in CHMP2B (FTD3) display major metabolic alterations compared to CRISPR/Cas9 generated isogenic controls. Using quantitative proteomics, 13C-labelling coupled to mass spectrometry metabolic mapping and seahorse analyses, molecular determinants and functional alterations of neuronal and astrocytic energy metabolism in FTD3 were characterized. Our findings implicate dysregulation of glutamate-glutamine homeostasis in FTD3 pathogenesis. In addition, FTD3 neurons recapitulate glucose hypometabolism observed in FTD patient brains. The impaired mitochondria function found here is concordant with disturbed TCA cycle activity and decreased glycolysis in FTD3 neurons. FTD3 neuronal glutamine hypermetabolism is associated with up-regulation of PAG expression and, possibly, ROS production. Distinct compartments of glutamate metabolism can be suggested for the FTD3 neurons. Endogenous glutamate generated from glutamine via PAG may enter the TCA cycle via AAT (left side of neuron) while exogenous glutamate taken up from the extracellular space may be incorporated into the TCA cycle via GDH (right side of the neuron) FTD3 astrocytic glutamate uptake is upregulated whilst glutamate metabolism is largely maintained. Finally, pharmacological reversal of glutamate hypometabolism manifesting from decreased GDH expression should be explored as a novel therapeutic intervention for treating FTD3.","FTD3, CHMP2B, iPSC-derived neuron, Glucose metabolism, Glutamate, Glutamine, GC-MS, GDH, PAG, GS",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00658-6,2020

Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor and breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential are key events during glutamate toxicity. Due to its manifold functions in nervous system physiology, however, the NMDA receptor is not well suited as a drug target. To identify novel compounds that act downstream of toxic NMDA receptor signaling and can protect mitochondria from glutamate toxicity, we developed a cell viability screening assay in primary mouse cortical neurons. In a proof-of-principle screen we tested 146 natural products and 424 FDA-approved drugs for their ability to protect neurons against NMDA-induced cell death. We confirmed several known neuroprotective drugs that include Dutasteride, Enalapril, Finasteride, Haloperidol, and Oxybutynin, and we identified neuroprotective properties of Elvitegravir. Using live imaging of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester-labelled primary cortical neurons, we found that Elvitegravir, Dutasteride, and Oxybutynin attenuated the NMDA-induced breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Patch clamp electrophysiological recordings in NMDA receptor-expressing HEK293 cell lines and primary mouse hippocampal neurons revealed that Elvitegravir does not act at the NMDA receptor and does not affect the function of glutamatergic synapses. In summary, we have developed a cost-effective and easy-to-implement screening assay in primary neurons and identified Elvitegravir as a neuro- and mitoprotective drug that acts downstream of the NMDA receptor.","Excitotoxicity, Mitochondria, Neuroprotection, NMDA receptor, Glutamate toxicity, Dutasteride, Finasteride, Oxybutynin, Channelrhodopsin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00641-1,2020

Furthermore, various studies have evaluated CYFIP2 functions in the postsynaptic compartment, such as regulating dendritic spine morphology; however, no study has evaluated whether and how CYFIP2 affects presynaptic functions. To address this issue, in this study, we have focused on the presynapses of layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adult Cyfip2 heterozygous (Cyfip2+/−) mice. Electrophysiological analyses revealed an enhancement in the presynaptic short-term plasticity induced by high-frequency stimuli in Cyfip2+/− neurons compared with wild-type neurons. Since presynaptic mitochondria play an important role in buffering presynaptic Ca2+, which is directly associated with the short-term plasticity, we analyzed presynaptic mitochondria using electron microscopic images of the mPFC. Compared with wild-type mice, the number, but not the volume or cristae density, of mitochondria in both presynaptic boutons and axonal processes in the mPFC layer 5 of Cyfip2+/− mice was reduced. Consistent with an identification of mitochondrial proteins in a previously established CYFIP2 interactome, CYFIP2 was detected in a biochemically enriched mitochondrial fraction of the mouse mPFC. Collectively, these results suggest roles for CYFIP2 in regulating presynaptic functions, which may involve presynaptic mitochondrial changes.","Presynapse, Mitochondria, Medial prefrontal cortex, Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00668-4,2020

Therefore, it is important to understand how the expression of BDNF is controlled under pathophysiological as well as physiological conditions. Here, we report a method to visualize changes in BDNF expression in the living mouse brain using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). We previously generated a novel transgenic mouse strain, Bdnf-Luciferase (Luc), to monitor changes in Bdnf expression; however, it was difficult to detect brain-derived signals in the strain using BLI with d-luciferin, probably because of incomplete substrate distribution and light penetration. We demonstrate that TokeOni, which uniformly distributes throughout the whole mouse body after systematic injection and produces a near-infrared bioluminescence light, was suitable for detecting signals from the brain of the Bdnf-Luc mouse. We clearly detected brain-derived bioluminescence signals that crossed the skin and skull after intraperitoneal injection of TokeOni. However, repeated BLI using TokeOni should be limited, because repeated injection of TokeOni on the same day reduced the bioluminescence signal, presumably by product inhibition. We successfully visualized kainic acid-induced Bdnf expression in the hippocampus and sensory stimulation-induced Bdnf expression in the visual cortex. Taken together, non-invasive near-infrared BLI using Bdnf-Luc mice with TokeOni allowed us to evaluate alterations in BDNF levels in the living mouse brain.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling plays a key role in controlling neuronal gene expression. Interestingly, REST/NRSF nuclear translocation and signaling, as well as mGluR5 signaling are altered in the presence of mutant huntingtin. It remains unclear whether mGluR5 can modulate Wnt and REST/NRSF signaling under physiological conditions and whether this modulation is altered in Huntington’s disease (HD). Using primary corticostriatal neurons derived from wild type mouse embryos, we find that targeting mGluR5 using the agonist, DHPG, or the negative allosteric modulator, CTEP, modulates REST/NRSF expression by regulating the assembly of N-cadherin/ β-catenin complex in a Src kinase-dependent manner. We have validated our in vitro findings in vivo using two HD mouse models. Specifically, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 in zQ175 mice and genetic ablation of mGluR5 in BACHD mice corrected the pathological activation of Src and rescued REST/NRSF-dependent signaling.

To further understand the roles of the 5-HT system implicated in developmental disorders such as ASD, comparison with model animals exhibiting different phenotypes may be useful. In this study, we investigated the relationship between sociability and the magnitude of 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) activation-induced outward currents from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the PFC, because a mouse model of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; another developmental disorder exhibiting low innate anxiety and high sociability) reportedly showed larger 5-HT-induced currents. To investigate whether the 5-HT1AR activation-induced outward currents are involved in the endophenotype determination of social behavior, we examined 15q dup mice with a phenotype opposite to WBS. We found 5-HT elicited significantly larger outward currents in 15q dup mice than in WT controls, regardless of sociability. In contrast, baclofen-induced GABAB receptor-mediated outward currents were not significantly different between genotypes, although GABAB receptor was coupled to Gi/o as well as 5-HT1A. Further, we found the larger 5-HT1AR-mediated currents in 15q dup mice did not affect the magnitude of inhibitory action of NMDA receptor functions.

However, evidence suggests that formation of fear memory to a discrete sensory cue is hippocampus-independent. Here, using a pharmacological reversible inactivation of dorsal hippocampus in auditory cued fear conditioning by local infusion of muscimol, we demonstrate in mice that hippocampus is critical for remote memory formation of learned fear to the discrete sensory cue. Muscimol infusion before conditioning did not affect formation of recent auditory fear memory as previously reported. Same muscimol infusion, however, impaired remote auditory fear memory. Muscimol infusion before remote test of auditory fear memory did not affect memory retrieval, indicating hippocampus is not a brain site for storage of remote cued fear memory. Moreover, memory reactivation enforced by re-exposure to the conditioned tone could compensate for hippocampal inactivation, as memory-reactivated mice showed normal remote auditory fear memory despite hippocampal inactivation.

In contrast, Fmr1-KO animals did not show such an alteration but displayed abnormal morphology of TH-positive axons in the striatum with higher “complexity” and lower “texture”. Both strains exhibited decreased expression of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and increased spatial coupling between vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1, a label for glutamatergic terminals) and TH signals, while GABAergic neurons quantified by glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) remained intact. Intranasal administration of DA rescued the deficits in non-selective attention, object-based attention and social approaching of BTBR mice, likely by enhancing the level of TH in the striatum. Application of intranasal DA to Fmr1-KO animals alleviated their impairment of social novelty, in association with reduced striatal TH protein.

Shank proteins are highly regulated by zinc, where zinc binds the Shank SAM domain to drive synaptic protein recruitment and synaptic maturation. Here we have examined the influence of maternal dietary zinc supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the development of ASD-associated behavioural and synaptic changes in the offspring Shank3 knockout (Shank3−/−) mice. Behavioural and electrophysiological experiments were performed in juvenile and adult Shank3−/− and wildtype littermate control mice born from mothers fed control (30 ppm, ppm) or supplemented (150 ppm) dietary zinc. We observed that the supplemented maternal zinc diet prevented ASD-associated deficits in social interaction and normalised anxiety behaviours in Shank3−/− offspring mice. These effects were maintained into adulthood. Repetitive grooming was also prevented in adult Shank3−/− offspring mice. At the synaptic level, maternal zinc supplementation altered postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents and presynaptic function at glutamatergic synapses onto medium spiny neurons in the cortico-striatal pathway of the Shank3−/− offspring mice. These data show that increased maternal dietary zinc during pregnancy and lactation can alter the development of ASD-associated changes at the synaptic and the behavioural levels, and that zinc supplementation from the beginning of brain development can prevent ASD-associated deficits in Shank3−/− mice long term.","Autism, Zinc, Shank3, Maternal diet, Glutamate, Synapse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00650-0,2020

Lepr is expressed in the embryonic brain as early as embryonic day 12.5. However, the function of Lepr in neural precursor cells in the brain has not been resolved. To address this issue, we crossed the Leprflox/flox mice with each of Shh-Cre mice (Shh, sonic hedgehog) and Nestin (Nes)-Cre mice. We found that deletion of Lepr specifically in nestin-expressing cells led to extreme obesity, but the conditional null of Lepr in Shh-expressing cells had no obvious phenotype. Moreover, the level of leptin-activated pSTAT3 decreased in the anterior and central subregions of the arcuate hypothalamus of Shh-Cre; Leprflox/flox mice compared with the controls. By contrast, in Nes-Cre; Leprflox/flox mice, the level of leptin-activated pSTAT3 decreased in all subregions including the anterior, central, and posterior arcuate hypothalamus as well as the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and median eminence of the hypothalamus, revealing that the extensive lack of Lepr in the differentiated neurons of the hypothalamus in the conditional null mice. Notably, conditional deletion of Lepr in nestin-expressing cells enhanced the differentiation of neural precursor cells into neurons and oligodendroglia but inhibited differentiation into astrocytes early in postnatal development of hypothalamus. Our results suggest that Lepr expression in neural precursor cells is essential for maintaining normal body weight as well as the differentiation of neural precursor cells to the neural/glial fate in the hypothalamus shortly after birth.","Hypothalamus, Leptin receptor, Arcuate nucleus, Neural stem cells, Neuronal differentiation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00647-9,2020

Accumulating evidence has shown a multifactorial interplay between the intracellular calcium elevation and α-Syn dynamics. However, whether membrane depolarization regulates toxic α-Syn aggregates remains unclear. To understand this better, we used an in vitro α-Syn preformed fibrils (PFF) model of PD in human neural cells. We demonstrated functional membrane depolarization in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells induced by two independent treatments: high extracellular K+ and the GABAA receptor blocker picrotoxin. We then observed that these treatments significantly alleviated toxic α-Syn aggregation in PFF-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, clinically relevant direct current stimulation (DCS) also remarkably decreased toxic α-Syn aggregation in PFF-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that membrane depolarization plays an important role in alleviating PFF-induced toxic α-Syn aggregates, and that it may represent a novel therapeutic mechanism for PD.","Parkinson’s disease, Membrane depolarization, Preformed fibrils, GABAA receptor, α-Synuclein, Calcium channel, Direct current stimulation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00648-8,2020

In the CTA, consumption of an appetitive tastant is associated with aversive experience such as visceral malaise, which results in avoidance of consuming a learned tastant. Previously, we showed that levels of the cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) determine the insular cortical neurons that proceed to encode a conditioned taste memory. In the amygdala and hippocampus, it is shown that CREB and neuronal activity regulate memory allocation and the neuronal mechanism that determines the specific neurons in a neural network that will store a given memory. However, cellular mechanism of memory allocation in the insular cortex is not fully understood. In the current study, we manipulated the neuronal activity in a subset of insular cortical and/or basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons in mice, at the time of learning; for this purpose, we used an hM3Dq designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug system (DREADD). Subsequently, we examined whether the neuronal population whose activity is increased during learning, is reactivated by memory retrieval, using the expression of immediate early gene c-fos. When an hM3Dq receptor was activated only in a subset of IC neurons, c-fos expression following memory retrieval was not significantly observed in hM3Dq-positive neurons. Interestingly, the probability of c-fos expression in hM3Dq-positive IC neurons after retrieval was significantly increased when the IC and BLA were co-activated during conditioning. Our findings suggest that functional interactions between the IC and BLA regulates CTA memory allocation in the insular cortex, which shed light on understanding the mechanism of memory allocation regulated by interaction between relevant brain areas.","Memory allocation, Insular cortex, Basolateral amygdala, Conditioned taste aversion, Taste memory, Functional interaction, Structural interaction",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00646-w,2020

In ovariectomized female rats, repeated forced swim (FS) stress induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the hindpaws of the 17β-estradiol (E2) treated rats with orofacial inflammation. Subcutaneous injection of E2, injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into masseter muscles or FS alone did not induce somatic hyperalgesia. We also found that the somatic hyperalgesia was accompanied by upregulation of GluN1 receptor and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)3A receptor expression in the dorsal horn of spinal cord at L4-L5 segments. Intrathecal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) or 5-HT3 receptor antagonist Y-25130 blocked stress-induced wide-spreading hyperalgesia.

In this study, we sought to determine if the histone deacetylase HDAC6 plays a role in dendrite development and neuronal migration of pyramidal neurons during cerebral cortex development. It was observed that knockdown of HDAC6 leads to defective dendrite morphogenesis and abnormal Golgi polarization in vitro, and the expression of wild type cortactin or deacetyl-mimetic cortactin 9KR rescued the defective phenotypes of the HDAC6 knockdown neurons. This suggests that HDAC6 promotes dendritic growth and Golgi polarization through cortactin deacetylation in vitro. We also demonstrated that ectopic expression of SIRT2, a cytoplasmic NAD+ − dependent deacetylase, suppresses the defects of HDAC6 knockdown neurons. These results indicate that HDAC6 and SIRT2 may be functionally redundant during dendrite development. Neurons transfected with both HDAC6 and SIRT2 shRNA or acetyl-mimetic cortactin 9KQ showed slow radial migration compared to the control cells during cerebral cortex development. Furthermore, a large portion of cortactin 9KQ-expressing pyramidal neurons at layer II/III in the cerebral cortex failed to form an apical dendrite toward the pial surface and had an increased number of primary dendrites, and the percentage of neurons with dendritic Golgi decreased in cortactin 9KQ-expressing cells, compared to control neurons.

The isthmus organizer locates to the mid-hindbrain (MHB) boundary region and serves as the critical signaling center during midbrain and cerebellar early patterning. To study the function of Yy1 in mesencephalon/ rhombomere 1 (mes/r1) neuroepithelium development, we utilized the tissue-specific Cre-LoxP system and generated a conditional knockout mouse line to inactivate Yy1 in the MHB region. Mice with Yy1 deletion in the mes/r1 region displayed cerebellar agenesis and dorsal midbrain hypoplasia. The Yy1 deleted neuroepithelial cells underwent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, with the concurrent changes of cell cycle regulatory genes expression, as well as activation of the p53 pathway. Moreover, we found that Yy1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of Wnt1 in neural stem cells. Thus, our work demonstrates the involvement of Yy1 in cerebellar agenesis and the critical function of Yy1 in mouse early MHB neuroepithelium maintenance and development.","Yy1, Cre-loxP, Cerebellar agenesis, Mid-hindbrain, Neuroepithelium, Wnt1, p53",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00643-z,2020

The most prominent difference between regions with and without scar-like astrogliosis was blood vessel formation. Blood vessels highly expressing collagen 1A1 formed densely near meninges, and astrocytes converged on them. In other regions, however, both blood vessels and astrocytes were relatively evenly distributed. Consistent with this, inhibition of blood vessel formation with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-blocking antibody, Avastin, attenuated scar-like astrogliosis near meninges.

However, how GBA mutations affect the pathogenesis of PD via abnormal aggregation of α-Syn is unclear, and no clinically valid PD-MCI genetic markers have been identified. Here, we first located a GBA eQTL, rs12411216, by analysing DHS, eQTL SNP, and transcription factor binding site data using the UCSC database.

In exploring the relationship between rs12411216 and GBA expression, the SNP was found to be associated with GBA expression in 50 PD patients through qPCR verification. In a further CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing module, the SNP was identified to cause a decrease in GBA expression, weaken enzymatic activity and enhance the abnormal aggregation of α-Syn in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we confirmed that the binding efficiency of transcription factor E2F4 was affected by the rs12411216 SNP.

We developed this system by splitting Cre recombinase into two fragments with evolved split inteins and subsequently expressed one fragment under the influence of a cell type-specific promoter in a transgenic animal, and delivered the other fragment via retrograde viral gene transfer. This approach results in the reconstitution of Cre recombinase in only specific population of neurons projecting from a specific brain region or in those of a specific neuronal type.

Consistent evidence shows that chronic pain attenuates activity in the prelimbic (PL) cortex, a mPFC subregion. This reduced activity is thought to be driven by increased inhibitory tone within PL circuits. Enhanced input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to inhibitory neurons in PL cortex is one well-received mechanism for this circuit change. In mice, we used retrograde labeling, brain slice recordings, and optogenetics to selectively stimulate and record ascending BLA inputs onto PL neurons that send projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a midbrain structure that plays a significant role in endogenous analgesia. Activating BLA projections evoked both excitatory and inhibitory currents in cortico-PAG (CP) neurons, as we have shown previously. We measured changes to the ratio of BLA-evoked excitatory to inhibitory currents in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. Our analysis reveals a reduced excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio of BLA inputs to PL-CP neurons 7 days after SNI. The E/I ratio of BLA inputs to CP neurons in neighboring infralimbic (IL) cortex was unchanged in SNI animals. Collectively, this study reveals that the overall E/I balance of BLA inputs to PL neurons projecting to the PAG is reduced in a robust neuropathic pain model.

The 5-HT1A and 2A receptors are widely expressed across the brain, but the target region(s) underlying the influence of those receptors on anxiety remain unknown. Interestingly, recent studies in human and non-human primates have shown that the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A binding potentials within the insular cortex (insula) are correlated to anxiety. As an initial step to define the function of 5-HT transmission in the insula, we quantified the proportion of specific neuronal populations of the insula expressing 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A. We analyzed seven neural populations, including three defined by a molecular marker (putative glutamate, GABA or parvalbumin), and four defined by their projections to different downstream targets. First, we found that more than 70% of putative glutamatergic neurons, and only 30% of GABAergic neurons express the 5-HT1A. Second, within insular projection neurons, 5-HT1A is highly expressed (75–80%) in the populations targeting one sub-nuclei of the amygdala (central or basolateral), or targeting the rostral or caudal sections of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Similarly, 70% of putative glutamatergic neurons and only 30% of insular GABAergic neurons contain 5-HT2A. Finally, the 5-HT2A is present in a majority of insula-amygdala and insula-LH projection neurons (73–82%).

However, the effects of ketamine on synaptic plasticity and their contribution to its mechanism of action as an antidepressant, are still unclear. We investigated ketamine’s effects on in vivo dorsal hippocampal (dHPC) synaptic plasticity and their role in mediating aspects of antidepressant activity in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) model of depression. dHPC long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly impaired in WKY rats compared to Wistar controls. Importantly, a single low dose (5 mg/kg, ip) of ketamine or its metabolite, (2R,6R)-HNK, rescued the LTP deficit in WKY rats at 3.5 h but not 30 min following injection, with residual effects at 24 h, indicating a delayed, sustained facilitatory effect on dHPC synaptic plasticity. Consistent with the observed dHPC LTP deficit, WKY rats exhibited impaired hippocampal-dependent long-term spatial memory as measured by the novel object location recognition test (NOLRT), which was effectively restored by pre-treatment with both ketamine or (2R,6R)-HNK. In contrast, in WKYs, which display abnormal stress coping, ketamine, but not (2R,6R)-HNK, had rapid and sustained effects in the forced swim test (FST), a commonly used preclinical screen for antidepressant-like activity. The differential effects of (2R,6R)-HNK observed here reveal a dissociation between drug effects on FST immobility and dHPC synaptic plasticity. Therefore, in the WKY rat model, restoring dHPC LTP was not correlated with ketamine’s effects in FST, but importantly, may have contributed to the reversal of hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits, which are critical features of clinical depression. Our findings support the theory that ketamine may reverse the stress-induced loss of connectivity in key neural circuits by engaging synaptic plasticity processes to “reset the system”.","Ketamine, Synaptic plasticity, LTP, Hippocampus, HNK, Antidepressant, Memory and cognition, Wistar-Kyoto rat, Model of depression",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00627-z,2020

Clarifying the specific Drp1 distribution could be a good approach to targeted treatment or prognosis.MethodsWe visualized the distribution of Drp1 in different brain regions and explicated the relationship between Drp1 and mitochondria. GAD67-GFP knock-in mice were utilized to detect the expression patterns of Drp1 in GABAergic neurons. We also further analyzed Drp1 expression in human malignant glioma tissue.ResultsDrp1 was widely but heterogeneously distributed in the central nervous system. Further observation indicated that Drp1 was highly and heterogeneously expressed in inhibitory neurons. Under transmission electron microscopy, the distribution of Drp1 was higher in dendrites than other areas in neurons, and only a small amount of Drp1 was localized in mitochondria. In human malignant glioma, the fluorescence intensity of Drp1 increased from grade I-III, while grade IV showed a declining trend.ConclusionIn this study, we observed a wide heterogeneous distribution of Drp1 in the central nervous system, which might be related to the occurrence and development of neurologic disease.

Ubiquitinated aggregates are observed in neurodegenerative diseases; this ultimately results in reduced levels of available or free Ub. However, it remains unclear whether neurotoxicity arises from the aggregates or a deficiency of free Ub. To investigate this, we treated primary neurons of mouse embryonic brains with amyloid beta (Aβ) 42 and found that free Ub levels were decreased and cell viability was reduced in Aβ42-treated neurons. As reduced levels of free Ub are closely related to impaired function of the proteasome, we evaluated proteasome activity and found that proteasome activity was reduced upon treatment of primary neurons and mouse brain slices with Aβ42.

Cx3cr1CreERT2 mice express Cre recombinase in a tamoxifen-inducible manner and have been widely used to delete target genes in microglia, since microglia are long-lived cells and outlive peripheral macrophages, which continuously turn over and lose their gene modification over time. ATG7 is an E1-like enzyme that plays an essential role in two ubiquitin-like reactions, ATG12-ATG5 conjugation and LC3-lipidation in autophagy. To study the role of ATG7 in adult microglia, we generated Cx3cr1CreERT2:Atg7fl/fl mice and deleted Atg7 at the age of 8 weeks, and found induction of intestinal adhesion. Since intestinal adhesion is caused by excessive inflammation, these results suggest that deletion of Atg7 in intestinal macrophages even for a short time results in inflammation that cannot be rescued by replenishment with wild-type intestinal macrophages.

Some common DISC1 variants have also been associated with schizophrenia in the general population, but those located far from the chromosomal translocation breakpoint likely have a different functional impact. We previously reported that DISC1 forms a protein complex with dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), the main target for antipsychotic medications. The D2R-DISC1 complex is elevated in brain tissue from schizophrenia patients and facilitates glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 signaling. The DISC1 R264Q variant is located within the region that binds the D2R, and we found that this polymorphism increases the affinity of DISC1 for the D2R and promotes GSK3 activity.

This study aimed to identify a link between PPA and autism phenotypes facilitated by signaling mechanisms in hippocampal neurons. Findings indicated autism-like pathogenesis associated with reduced dendritic spines in PPA-treated hippocampal neurons. To uncover the mechanisms underlying this loss, we evaluated autophagic flux, a functional readout of autophagy, using relevant biomedical markers. Results indicated that autophagic flux is impaired in PPA-treated hippocampal neurons. At a molecular level, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was activated and autophagic activity was impaired. We also observed that a MAPK inhibitor rescued dendritic spine loss in PPA-treated hippocampal neurons. Taken together, these results suggest a previously unknown link between PPA and autophagy in spine formation regulation in hippocampal neurons via MAPK/ERK signaling. Our results indicate that MAPK/ERK signaling participates in autism pathogenesis by autophagy disruption affecting dendritic spine density.

Conditional inactivation of DOT1L using Wnt1-cre as driver (Dot1l-cKO) showed that DOT1L expression is essential for spinal cord neurogenesis and localization of diverse neuronal subtypes, similar to its function in the development of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DOT1L deficiency favored differentiation over progenitor proliferation. Dot1l-cKO mainly decreased the numbers of dI1 interneurons expressing Lhx2. In contrast, Lhx9 expressing dI1 interneurons did not change in numbers but localized differently upon Dot1l-cKO. Similarly, loss of DOT1L affected localization but not generation of dI2, dI3, dI5, V0 and V1 interneurons. The resulting derailed interneuron patterns might be responsible for increased cell death, occurrence of which was restricted to the late developmental stage E18.5.

To address this question, we asked whether chronic treatment with clozapine can induce obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)-like behavior in mice. We injected mice with long-term continuous release pellets embedded with clozapine four times at 60-day intervals and then monitored the mice for signs of OCD-like behavior up to 40 wk. of age.

Because ASD is a neurodevelopmental disease that emerges early in childhood, we analyzed juvenile and adolescent brains. Distinct patterns of PRODYNORPHIN-positive and calbindin-poor striosomes were detected in the caudate nucleus of control brains by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. By contrast, PRODYNORPHIN-positive and calbindin-poor striosomes were decreased in the caudate nucleus of young ASD brains.

Microglia and infiltrating monocytes are likely candidates to drive these neuroinflammatory insults. However, the exact molecular identity / transcriptomic profile of microglia following ocular hypertensive insults is unknown. To elucidate the molecular identity of microglia after long-term exposure to ocular hypertension, we used a mouse model of glaucoma (DBA/2 J). We performed RNA-sequencing of microglia mRNA from the optic nerve head at a time point following ocular hypertensive insults, but preceding detectable neurodegeneration (with microglia identified as being CD45lo/CD11b+/CD11c−). Furthermore, RNA-sequencing was performed on optic nerve head microglia from mice treated with radiation therapy, a potent therapy preventing neuroinflammatory insults. Transcriptomic profiling of optic nerve head microglia mRNA identifies metabolic priming with marked changes in mitochondrial gene expression, and changes to phagocytosis, inflammatory, and sensome pathways. The data predict that many functions of microglia that help maintain tissue homeostasis are affected. Comparative analysis of these data with data from previously published whole optic nerve head tissue or monocyte-only samples from DBA/2 J mice demonstrate that many of the neuroinflammatory signatures in these data sets arise from infiltrating monocytes and not reactive microglia.

Here we present a two-compartment model of the synapse in which the presynaptic terminal first acts to filter presynaptic input before the postsynaptic terminal, acting as a gain controller, amplifies or depresses transmission. We argue that both compartments are equipped with distinct plasticity rules to enable them to optimally adapt synaptic transmission to the statistics of pre- and postsynaptic activity.

We further employed patch-clamp intracellular recordings to examine single-cell excitability. We report of the capability of fNPC to mature when combined to hippocampal neurons, shaping the profile of network activity, a result suggestive of newly formed connectivity ex vivo.","Microelectrode arrays, Cell electrophysiology, Neuronal networks, Neuronal progenitor cells, Hippocampus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00619-z,2020

The majority of FUS mutations are missense mutations affecting the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) of FUS. In addition, a number of frameshift mutations which result in complete NLS deletion have been described. Patients bearing frameshift mutations usually present with more aggressive disease, characterised by an early onset and rapid progression. Both missense mutations in the NLS coding sequence and complete loss of the NLS are known to result in cytoplasmic mislocalisation of FUS protein. However, in addition to the removal of FUS functional domains, frameshift mutations in most cases lead to the attachment of a “tail” of novel amino acids at the FUS C-terminus – a frameshift peptide. It is not clear whether these peptide tails would affect the properties of truncated FUS proteins. In the current study, we compared intracellular behaviour of disease-associated truncated FUS proteins with and without the corresponding frameshift peptides. We demonstrate that some of these peptides can affect subcellular distribution and/or increase aggregation capacity and stability of the truncated FUS protein. Our study suggests that frameshift peptides can alter the properties of truncated FUS variants which may modulate FUS pathogenicity and contribute to the variability of the disease course in ALS-FUS.","Fused in sarcoma, FUS, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, Frameshift mutation, Frameshift peptide, Stress granule",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00618-0,2020

However, the pathophysiology of the gene mutations is far from clear. Here we report a novel SLC6A1 missense mutation in a patient with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder and characterized the molecular defects of the mutant GAT-1, from transporter protein trafficking to GABA uptake function in heterologous cells and neurons. The heterozygous missense mutation (c1081C to A (P361T)) in SLC6A1 was identified by exome sequencing. We have thoroughly characterized the molecular pathophysiology underlying the clinical phenotypes. We performed EEG recordings and autism diagnostic interview. The patient had neurodevelopmental delay, absence epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, and 2.5–3 Hz generalized spike and slow waves on EEG recordings. The impact of the mutation on GAT-1 function and trafficking was evaluated by 3H GABA uptake, structural simulation with machine learning tools, live cell confocal microscopy and protein expression in mouse neurons and nonneuronal cells. We demonstrated that the GAT-1(P361T) mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation and reduces total protein expression. The mutant transporter protein was localized intracellularly inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a pattern of expression very similar to the cells treated with tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer. Radioactive 3H-labeled GABA uptake assay indicated the mutation reduced the function of the mutant GAT-1(P361T), to a level that is similar to the cells treated with GAT-1 inhibitors. In summary, this mutation destabilizes the mutant transporter protein, which results in retention of the mutant protein inside cells and reduction of total transporter expression, likely via excessive endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation. This thus likely causes reduced functional transporter number on the cell surface, which then could cause the observed reduced GABA uptake function. Consequently, malfunctioning GABA signaling may cause altered neurodevelopment and neurotransmission, such as enhanced tonic inhibition and altered cell proliferation in vivo. The pathophysiology due to severely impaired GAT-1 function may give rise to a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism and epilepsy.","Endoplasmic reticulum, Degradation, Mutation, GABA transporter 1, Protein stability, 3H GABA uptake, Autism, Epilepsy",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00612-6,2020

However, the presence in genomes of the studied mouse lines of additional genetic modifications that affect expression of genes located in a close proximity to the alpha-synuclein-encoding Snca gene makes these data open to various interpretations. To unambiguously demonstrate that the absence of alpha-synuclein is the primary cause of the observed deficit of dopaminergic neurons, we employed a recently produced constituent alpha-synuclein knockout mouse line B6(Cg)-Sncatm1.2Vlb/J. The only modification introduced to the genome of these mice is a substitution of the first coding exon and adjusted short intronic fragments of the Snca gene by a single loxP site. We compared the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc of this line, previously studied B6(Cg)-Sncatm1Rosl/J line and wild type littermate mice. A similar decrease was observed in both knockout lines when compared with wild type mice. In a recently published study we revealed no loss of dopaminergic neurons following conditional inactivation of the Snca gene in neurons of adult mice. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that alpha-synuclein is required for efficient survival or maturation of dopaminergic neurons in the developing SNpc but is dispensable for survival of mature SNpc dopaminergic neurons.","Dopaminergic neurons, Substantia nigra, Striatum, Alpha-synuclein, Null mutant mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00613-5,2020

Soluble ST2 is regarded as a key molecule regulating immune system as well as cell proliferation. Indeed, soluble ST2 is reported to reduce IL-33-induced IL-6 and TNF-α production in macrophages and IL-33-induced IL-5 and IL-13 production in type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Elevated serum concentrations of soluble ST2 have been reported in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting pathophysiological roles of soluble ST2 in behavioral phenotypes. Nevertheless, the relation between soluble ST2 and depressive behavior remain to be uncovered. To complement this point, we performed broad behavioral phenotyping, utilizing transgenic mice with a high concentration of serum ST2 in the present study. Soluble ST2 overexpression mice (ST2 Tg mice) were generated on a C3H/HeJ background. ST2 Tg mice crossed onto the BALB/c genetic background were used. Before starting tests, each mouse was observed in a clean cage for a general health check and neurological screening tests. In Experiment I, comprehensive behavioral phenotyping was performed to reveal the role of soluble ST2 on sensorimotor functions, anxiety-like behaviors, depression-like behaviors, social behaviors, and learning and memory functions. In Experiment II, to confirm the role of soluble ST2 on depression-like behaviors, a depression test battery (two bottle choice test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test) was applied. The general health check indicated good general health and normal gross appearance for ST2 Tg mice. Further, the neurological reflexes of all the mice were normal. We found that soluble ST2 overexpression resulted in decreased social interaction. Moreover, depression-like behaviors of ST2 Tg mice were observed in two well-established behavioral paradigms, the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test. Nevertheless, hedonic reaction to sucrose was observed in ST2 Tg mice similar to WT mice. These results suggest the depression in the ST2 Tg mice. In conclusion, through a series of experiments, we established the animal model for assessing role of soluble ST2 in neuropsychiatric disorders, and revealed the possible involvement of soluble ST2 in depressive behavior.","Soluble ST2, Depression, Mouse, Forced swimming test, Tail suspension test",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00606-4,2020

The number of persons experiencing this type of pain is substantial, affecting upwards of 50 million adults in the United States. Pharmacotherapy of most of the severe chronic pain patients includes drugs such as gabapentinoids, re-uptake blockers and opioids. Unfortunately, gabapentinoids are not effective in up to two-thirds of this population and although opioids can be initially effective, their long-term use is associated with multiple side effects. Therefore, there is a great need to develop novel non-opioid alternative therapies to relieve chronic pain. For this purpose, we screened a small library of natural products and their derivatives in the search for pharmacological inhibitors of voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels, which are outstanding molecular targets due to their important roles in nociceptive pathways. We discovered that the acetylated derivative of the ent-kaurane diterpenoid, geopyxin A, 1-O-acetylgeopyxin A, blocks voltage-gated calcium and tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels but not tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Consistent with inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, 1-O-acetylgeopyxin A reduced reduce action potential firing frequency and increased firing threshold (rheobase) in DRG neurons. Finally, we identified the potential of 1-O-acetylgeopyxin A to reverse mechanical allodynia in a preclinical rat model of HIV-induced sensory neuropathy. Dual targeting of both sodium and calcium channels may permit block of nociceptor excitability and of release of pro-nociceptive transmitters.

Ablating microglia in prion-infected brain by treatment with the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor, PLX5622, increased accumulation of misfolded prion protein and decreased survival time.MethodsTo better understand the role of glia during neurodegeneration, we used RNA-seq technology, network analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis to compare gene expression in brains of prion-infected versus mock-inoculated mice. Comparisons were also made between PLX5622-treated prion-infected mice and untreated prion-infected mice to assess mechanisms involved in disease acceleration in the absence of microglia.ResultsRNA-seq and network analysis suggested that microglia responded to prion infection through activation of integrin CD11c/18 and did not adopt the expression signature associated with other neurodegenerative disease models. Instead, microglia acquired an alternative molecular signature late in the disease process. Furthermore, astrocytes expressed a signature pattern of genes which appeared to be specific for prion diseases. Comparisons were also made with prion-infected mice treated with PLX5622 to assess the impact of microglia ablation on astrocyte gene expression during prion infection. In the presence of microglia, a unique mix of transcripts associated with A1- and A2-reactive astrocytes was increased in brains of prion-infected mice. After ablation of microglia, this reactive astrocyte expression pattern was enhanced. Thus, after prion infection, microglia appeared to decrease the overall A1/A2-astrocyte responses which might contribute to increased survival after infection.ConclusionsRNA-seq analysis indicated dysregulation of over 300 biological processes within the CNS during prion disease. Distinctive microglia- and astrocyte-associated expression signatures were identified during prion infection. Furthermore, astrogliosis and the unique astrocyte-associated expression signature were independent of microglial influences. Astrogliosis and the unique astrocyte-associated gene expression pattern were increased when microglia were ablated.

Feedforward inhibition driven by the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) has been previously observed, but its physiological function and regulation remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that elevated neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex is required for the short-term storage of information. Furthermore, the elevated neuronal activity is supported by the reciprocal connectivity between the MD and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Therefore, detailed knowledge about the synaptic connections during high-frequency activity is critical for understanding the mechanism of short-term memory. In this study, we examined how feedforward inhibition of thalamofrontal connectivity is modulated by activity frequency. We observed greater short-term synaptic depression during disynaptic inhibition than in thalamic excitatory synapses during high-frequency activities. The strength of feedforward inhibition became weaker as the stimulation continued, which, in turn, enhanced the range of firing jitter in a frequency-dependent manner. We postulated that this phenomenon was primarily due to the increased failure rate of evoking action potentials in parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest that the MD-mPFC pathway is dynamically regulated by an excitatory-inhibitory balance in an activity-dependent manner. During low-frequency activities, excessive excitations are inhibited, and firing is restricted to a limited temporal range by the strong feedforward inhibition. However, during high-frequency activities, such as during short-term memory, the activity can be transferred in a broader temporal range due to the decreased feedforward inhibition.","Thalamofrontal, Feedforward inhibition, Mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, Short-term memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00608-2,2020

A high-throughput phenotypic screen was conducted using a CCF-STTG1 human astrocytoma cell line to identify small molecules that could upregulate apoE secretion. AZ7235, a previously discovered Axl kinase inhibitor, was identified to have robust apoE activity in brain microglia, astrocytes and pericytes. AZ7235 also increased expression of ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1), which is involved in the lipidation and secretion of apoE. Moreover, AZ7235 did not exhibit Liver-X-Receptor (LXR) activity and stimulated apoE and ABCA1 expression in the absence of LXR. Target validation studies using AXL−/− CCF-STTG1 cells showed that Axl is required to mediate AZ7235 upregulation of apoE and ABCA1. Intriguingly, apoE expression and secretion was significantly attenuated in AXL-deficient CCF-STTG1 cells and reconstitution of Axl or kinase-dead Axl significantly restored apoE baseline levels, demonstrating that Axl also plays a role in maintaining apoE homeostasis in astrocytes independent of its kinase activity. Lastly, these effects may require human apoE regulatory sequences, as AZ7235 exhibited little stimulatory activity toward apoE and ABCA1 in primary murine glia derived from neonatal human APOE3 targeted-replacement mice.

We further provide evidence that the levels of HIF-1α and LDHA are increased after rat I/R injury and that arginine treatment prevents the elevation of HIF-1α and LDHA after I/R injury. Arginine inhibits inflammatory response through suppression of HIF-1α and LDHA in the rat ischemic brain tissue and in the cultured microglia following OGD insult, and protects against ischemic neuron death after rat I/R injury by attenuating HIF-1α/LDHA-mediated inflammatory response. Together, these results indicate a possibility that arginine-induced neuroprotective effect may be through the suppression of HIF-1α/LDHA-mediated inflammatory response in microglia after cerebral ischemia injury.","Arginine, Neuroinflammation, Ischemia stroke, LDHA, HIF-1α, Neuroprotection",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00601-9,2020

Here we performed global metabolomics profiling of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex (FC) in a model of voluntary running in mice. Examined brain structures responded differentially to physical activity. Specifically, the markers of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were downregulated in the FC, whereas glycolysis was enhanced in the hippocampus. Physical activity stimulated production of myristic, palmitic and stearic FA; i.e., the primary end products of de novo lipogenesis in the brain, which was accompanied by increased expression of hippocampal fatty acid synthase (FASN), suggesting stimulation of lipid synthesis. The changes in the brain fatty acid profile were associated with reduced anxiety level in the running mice.

Chronic morphine regulates TRPM8 channels via MOR-PKCβ signaling,"Mircea Iftinca1,, Lilian Basso1,, Robyn Flynn2,, Charlie Kwok2,, Corinne Roland1,, Ahmed Hassan1,, Manon Defaye1,, Rithwik Ramachandran3,, Tuan Trang2 &, Christophe Altier1",Christophe Altier,altier@ucalgary.ca,2020-04-14,"Postoperative shivering and cold hypersensitivity are major side effects of acute and chronic opioid treatments respectively. TRPM8 is a cold and menthol-sensitive channel found in a subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Deletion or inhibition of the TRPM8 channel was found to prevent the cold hyperalgesia induced by chronic administration of morphine. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which morphine was able to promote cold hypersensitivity in DRG neurons and transfected HEK cells. Mice daily injected with morphine for 5 days developed cold hyperalgesia. Treatment with morphine did not alter the expressions of cold sensitive TREK-1, TRAAK and TRPM8 in DRGs. However, TRPM8-expressing DRG neurons isolated from morphine-treated mice exhibited hyperexcitability. Sustained morphine treatment in vitro sensitized TRPM8 responsiveness to cold or menthol and reduced activation-evoked desensitization of the channel. Blocking phospholipase C (PLC) as well as protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), but not protein kinase A (PKA) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), restored channel desensitization. Identification of two PKC phosphorylation consensus sites, S1040 and S1041, in the TRPM8 and their site-directed mutation were able to prevent the MOR-induced reduction in TRPM8 desensitization. Our results show that activation of MOR by morphine 1) promotes hyperexcitability of TRPM8-expressing neurons and 2) induces a PKCβ-mediated reduction of TRPM8 desensitization. This MOR-PKCβ dependent modulation of TRPM8 may underlie the onset of cold hyperalgesia caused by repeated administration of morphine. Our findings point to TRPM8 channel and PKCβ as important targets for opioid-induced cold hypersensitivity.","Transient receptor potential channel subfamily M (melastatin) member 8 (TRPM8), Mu opioid receptor (MOR), Morphine, Protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, Cold hyperalgesia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00599-0,2020

However, dopaminergic signaling is also relevant to various physical functions, including nociception. The zona incerta is a subthalamic nucleus in which the A13 dopaminergic cell group resides, but how this A13 group affects nociceptive processing remains unknown. Recently, we showed that acute nociceptive stimuli rapidly induce the activity of A10 (ventral tegmental area) dopamine neurons via fiber photometry. In this study, we measured the activity of A13 dopaminergic neurons in response to acute nociceptive stimuli using the same system. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV-CAG-FLEX-G-CaMP6 and AAV-CAG-FLEX-mCherry) were unilaterally injected into the A13 site in transgenic mice carrying a dopamine transporter promotor-regulated Cre recombinase transgene to specifically introduce G-CaMP6/mCherry into A13 dopaminergic cell bodies through site-specific infection. We measured G-CaMP6/mCherry fluorescence intensity in the A13 site to acute nociceptive stimuli (pinch stimulus and heat stimulus). These stimuli significantly induced a rapid increase in G-CaMP6 fluorescence intensity, but non-nociceptive control stimuli did not. In contrast, mCherry fluorescence intensity was not significantly changed by nociceptive stimuli or non-nociceptive stimuli. Our finding is the first report to measure the activity of A13 dopaminergic neurons to aversive stimuli. A13 dopaminergic neurons project to the periaqueductal gray and the central nucleus of the amygdala, which are both well known as key regions in nociceptive processing. Therefore, together with our A10 study, our results indicate that A13 dopaminergic neurons play important roles in nociceptive processing.","Nociception, A13 dopaminergic cell group, zona incerta, G-CaMP6, Fiber photometry, DAT-Cre mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00600-w,2020

To address the role of SENP2 in the CNS and its potential involvement in neuropathology, we generated SENP2 conditional knockout mice by crossing floxed SENP2 mice with CaMKIIα-Cre transgenic mice. Behavioral tests revealed that SENP2 ablation induced hyper-locomotor activity, anxiolytic-like behaviors, spatial working memory impairment and fear-associated learning defect. In line with these observations, our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data identified a variety of differential expression genes that are particularly enriched in locomotion, learning and memory related biologic process.

In studying approaches to mitigate this calcium overload, we identified the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), an axonal guidance protein that participates in synapse dynamics by interacting with and regulating activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We further identified a 15 amino acid peptide from CRMP2 (designated CBD3, for calcium-binding domain 3), that reduced NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx in cultured neurons and post-synaptic NMDAR-mediated currents in cortical slices. Whether targeting CRMP2 could be therapeutically beneficial in AD is unknown. Here, using CBD3, we tested the utility of this approach. Employing the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD which demonstrates robust pathophysiology including Aβ1–42 deposition, altered tau levels, and diminished cognitive functions, we asked if overexpression of CBD3 could rescue these events. CBD3 was engineered into an adeno-associated vector and nasally delivered into APP/PS1 mice and then biochemical (immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting), cellular (TUNEL apoptosis assays), and behavioral (Morris water maze test) assessments were performed. APP/PS1 mice administered adeno-associated virus (AAV, serotype 2) harboring CBD3 demonstrated: (i) reduced levels of Aβ1–42 and phosphorylated-tau (a marker of AD progression), (ii) reduced apoptosis in the hippocampus, and (iii) reduced cognitive decline compared with APP/PS1 mice or APP/PS1 administered a control virus. These results provide an instructive example of utilizing a peptide-based approach to unravel protein-protein interactions that are necessary for AD pathology and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of CRMP2 as a novel protein player in AD.","Alzheimer’s disease, Calcium channel-binding domain 3, Apoptosis, APP/PS1 mice, Amyloid beta",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00596-3,2020

However, its long-term dynamic transcriptional changes remain poorly understood. It is also unknown whether this neuroinflammation contributes to the recovery or just deteriorates the outcome. The purpose of this study is to characterize the temporal transcriptional changes in the post-stroke brain focusing on DAMPs-related genes by RNA-sequencing during the period of 28 days. We conducted the RNA-sequencing on day 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 post-stroke in the mouse photothrombosis model. The gross morphological observation showed the ischemic lesion on the ipsilateral cortex turned into a scar with the clearance of cellular debris by day 28. The transcriptome analyses indicated that post-stroke period of 28 days was classified into four categories (I Baseline, II Acute, III Sub-acute-#1, IV Sub-acute-#2 phase). During this period, the well-known genes for DAMPs, receptors, downstream cascades, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and phagocytosis were transcriptionally increased. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of biological process indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are genetically programmed to achieve immune and inflammatory pathways. Interestingly, we found the biphasic induction of various genes, including DAMPs and pro-inflammatory factors, peaking at acute and sub-acute phases. At the sub-acute phase, we also observed the induction of genes for phagocytosis as well as regulatory and growth factors. Further, we found the activation of CREB (cAMP-response element binding protein), one of the key players for neuronal plasticity, in peri-ischemic neurons by immunohistochemistry at this phase. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility the recurrent inflammation occurs at the sub-acute phase in the post-stroke brain, which could be involved in the debris clearance as well as neural reorganization.","Ischemic stroke, DAMPs, Sterile neuroinflammation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00598-1,2020

Netrin-1 recruits GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and is critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses, while conditional DCC deletion from glutamatergic neurons impairs hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and severely disrupts LTP induction. DCC co-fractionates with the detergent-resistant component of postsynaptic density, yet is enriched in axonal growth cones that differentiate into presynaptic terminals during development. Specific presynaptic and postsynaptic contributions of DCC to the function of mature neural circuits have yet to be identified. Employing hippocampal subregion-specific conditional deletion of DCC, we show that DCC loss from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons resulted in deficits in spatial memory, increased resting membrane potential, abnormal dendritic spine morphology, weaker spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic activity, and reduced levels of postsynaptic adaptor and signaling proteins; however, the capacity to induce LTP remained intact. In contrast, deletion of DCC from CA3 neurons did not induce detectable changes in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but impaired performance on the novel object place recognition task as well as compromised excitatory synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses. Together, these findings reveal specific pre- and post-synaptic contributions of DCC to hippocampal synaptic plasticity underlying spatial memory.","CA1 pyramidal neurons, Schaffer collaterals, Long-term potentiation, Axon guidance, Spatial memory, SHANK, PSD-95, S6, p34-arc, Arp2/3, Guidance cues, Netrin-1, Learning, Deleted-in-colorectal cancer",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00597-2,2020

Brown,rebrown@dal.ca,2020-04-06,"The Organization of Behavior has played a significant part in the development of behavioural neuroscience for the last 70 years. This book introduced the concepts of the “Hebb synapse”, the “Hebbian cell assembly” and the “Phase sequence”. The most frequently cited of these is the Hebb synapse, but the cell assembly may be Hebb’s most important contribution. Even after 70 years, Hebb’s theory is still relevant because it is a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the development of neural networks. The Organization of Behavior was Hebb’s 40th publication. His first published papers in 1937 were on the innate organization of the visual system and he first used the phrase “the organization of behavior” in 1938. However, Hebb wrote a number of unpublished papers between 1932 and 1945 in which he developed the ideas published in The Organization of Behavior. Thus, the concept of the neural organization of behavior was central to Hebb’s thinking from the beginning of his academic career. But his thinking about the organization of behavior in 1949 was different from what it was between 1932 and 1937. This paper examines Hebb’s early ideas on the neural basis of behavior and attempts to trace the rather arduous series of steps through which he developed these ideas into the book that was published as The Organization of Behavior. Using the 1946 typescript and Hebb’s correspondence we can see a number of changes made in the book before it was published. Finally, a number of issues arising from the book, and the importance of the book today are discussed.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00567-8,2020

Previously, we compared gene expressions between Shank2 KOs lacking exon 6–7 (e6–7 KO) and KOs lacking exon 7 (e7 KO) by performing RNA-seq. In this study, we expanded transcriptomic analyses to identify novel transcriptional variants in the KO mice. We found prominent expression of a novel exon (exon 4′ or e4’) between the existing exons 4 and 5 in the Shank2 e6–7 KO model. Expression of the transcriptional variant harboring this novel exon was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blotting. These findings suggest that the novel variant may function as a modifier gene, which contributes to the differences between the two Shank2 mutant lines. Furthermore, our result further represents an example of genetic compensation that may lead to phenotypic heterogeneity among ASD patients with mutations in the same gene.","Autism spectrum disorder, RNA-seq, Shank2",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00595-4,2020
Activity-dependent redistribution of CaMKII in the postsynaptic compartment of hippocampal neurons,Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng1,Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng,chengs@ninds.nih.gov,2020-04-01,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an abundant protein in neurons, is involved in synaptic plasticity and learning. CaMKII associates with multiple proteins located at or near the postsynaptic density (PSD), and CaMKII is known to translocate from cytoplasm to PSD under excitatory conditions. The present study examined the laminar distribution of CaMKII at the PSD by immunogold labeling in dissociated hippocampal cultures under low calcium (EGTA or APV), control, and stimulated (depolarization with high K+ or NMDA) conditions. The patterns of CaMKII distribution are classified with particular reference to the two layers of the PSD: (1) the PSD core, a layer within ~ 30–40 nm to the postsynaptic membrane, and (2) the PSD pallium, a deeper layer beyond the PSD core, ~ 100–120 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. Under low calcium conditions, a subpopulation (40%) of synapses stood out with no CaMKII labeling at the PSD, indicating that localization of CaMKII at the PSD is sensitive to calcium levels. Under control conditions, the majority (~ 60–70%) of synapses had label for CaMKII dispersed evenly in the spine, including the PSD and the nearby cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, the majority (60–75%) of synapses had label for CaMKII concentrated at the PSD, delineating the PSD pallium from the cytoplasm. Median distance of label for CaMKII to postsynaptic membrane was higher in low calcium samples (68–77 nm), than in control (59–63 nm) and stimulated samples (49–53 nm). Thus, upon stimulation, not only more CaMKII translocated to the PSD, but they also were closer to the postsynaptic membrane. Additionally, there were two relatively infrequent labeling patterns that may represent intermediate stages of CaMKII distribution between basal and stimulated conditions: (1) one type showed label preferentially localized near the PSD core where CaMKII may be binding to NR2B, an NMDA receptor concentrated at the PSD core, and (2) the second type showed label preferentially in the PSD pallium, where CaMKII may be binding to Shank, a PSD scaffold protein located in the PSD pallium. Both of these distribution patterns may portray the initial stages of CaMKII translocation upon synaptic activation. In addition to binding to PSD proteins, the concentrated CaMKII labeling at the PSD under heightened excitatory conditions could also be formed by self-clustering of CaMKII molecules recruited to the PSD. Most importantly, these accumulated CaMKII molecules do not extend beyond the border of the PSD pallium, and are likely held in the pallium by binding to Shank under these conditions.","Electron microscopy, Immunogold labeling, CaMKII, PSD, Shank",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00594-5,2020

In this study, we focused on the role of miR-326 and its target gene δ-opioid receptor (DOR) in the pathogenesis of neonatal HIBD. The expression levels of miR-326 and DOR after hypoxic-ischemic injury were examined both in vivo and in vitro. The direct relationship between miR-326 and DOR was confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Further, effects of miR-326 on cell viability and apoptosis levels under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were analyzed. The expression levels of miR-326 were significantly lower and DOR levels were significantly higher in the HIBD group than the control group both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of miR-326 downregulated the expression of DOR, while suppression of miR-326 upregulated the expression of DOR. The dual-luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that DOR could be directly targeted and regulated by miR-326. MiR-326 knockdown improved cell survival and decreased cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax and increasing Bcl-2 expression in PC12 cells after exposure to OGD. Moreover, DOR knockdown rescued the effect of the improved cell survival and suppressed cell apoptosis induced by silencing miR-326.

Excessive loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine–producing neurons. In mice, however, aging-related dopaminergic neuronal loss and its consequences for motor function are poorly understood. We observed the phenotype of wild-type C57BL/6 mice over an extended period of time. C57BL/6 mice exhibited age-dependent locomotor impairments, including hindlimb defects and the number of dopaminergic neurons decreased in aged mice, contributing to locomotor dysfunction. We observed a reduction in striatal dopamine levels in aged mice using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Thus, dopamine levels are affected by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, fragmented mitochondria were observed in dopaminergic neurons of aged mice but not in those of young mice. Aging-related dopaminergic neuronal loss and accumulation of damaged mitochondria may underlie the pathophysiology of aging.","Dopaminergic neuron, C57BL/6 mouse, Aging, Mitochondria",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00585-6,2020

Trans-synaptic tracing with neurotropic viruses has become one of the most effective technologies to dissect the neural circuits. Although the retrograde trans-synaptic tracing for analyzing the input neural networks with recombinant rabies and pseudorabies virus has been broadly applied in neuroscience, viral tools for analyzing the output neural networks are still lacking. The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been used for the mapping of synaptic outputs. However, several drawbacks, including high neurotoxicity and rapid lethality in experimental animals, hinder its application in long-term studies of the structure and function of neural networks. To overcome these limitations, we generated a recombinant VSV with replication-related N gene mutation, VSV-NR7A, and examined its cytotoxicity and efficiency of trans-synaptic spreading. We found that by comparison with the wild-type tracer of VSV, the NR7A mutation endowed the virus lower rate of propagation and cytotoxicity in vitro, as well as significantly reduced neural inflammatory responses in vivo and much longer animal survival when it was injected into the nucleus of the mice brain. Besides, the spreading of the attenuated VSV was delayed when injected into the VTA. Importantly, with the reduced toxicity and extended animal survival, the number of brain regions that was trans-synaptically labeled by the mutant VSV was more than that of the wild-type VSV. These results indicated that the VSV-NR7A, could be a promising anterograde tracer that enables researchers to explore more downstream connections of a given brain region, and observe the anatomical structure and the function of the downstream circuits over a longer time window. Our work could provide an improved tool for structural and functional studies of neurocircuit.","Neurotropic virus, Output network tracing, Vesicular stomatitis virus, Attenuated cytotoxicity, Enhanced anterograde trans-synaptic tracing",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00588-3,2020

An optical fiber was implanted just above the lateral amygdala of the animal. Optogenetic high-frequency stimuli (oHFS; containing five 1-s trains of 100 Hz laser pulses) were delivered to the lateral amygdala, before or after (with varying intervals) a foot-shock that elicits fear responses in the animal.

Proper water and potassium homeostasis in retina depends on these membrane specializations. Here we show that targeted deletion of β1-syntrophin leads to a partial loss of AQP4 from perivascular Müller cell endfeet and that a concomitant deletion of both α1- and β1-syntrophin causes a near complete loss of AQP4 from both perivascular and subvitreal endfoot membranes. α1-syntrophin is normally very weakly expressed in Müller cell endfeet but β1-syntrophin knockout mice display an increased amount of α1-syntrophin at these sites. We suggest that upregulation of perivascular α1-syntrophin restricts the effect of β1-syntrophin deletion. The present findings indicate that β1-syntrophin plays an important role in maintaining the functional polarity of Müller cells and that α1-syntrophin can partially substitute for β1-syntrophin in AQP4 anchoring.

Whether and to what degree LTP induction also enhances presynaptic glutamate release has been the subject of debate. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed genetically encoded optical sensors of glutamate (iGluSnFR) to monitor its release at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. We attempted to trace release events at multiple synapses simultaneously, by using two-photon excitation imaging in fast frame-scanning mode. We thus detected a significant increase in the average iGluSnFR signal during potentiation, which lasted for up to 90 min. This increase may reflect an increased amount of released glutamate or, alternatively, reduced glutamate binding to high-affinity glutamate transporters that compete with iGluSnFR.","Glutamate release, Optical glutamate sensor, LTP, Two-photon excitation imaging, Acute hippocampal slices",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00572-x,2020

Recent studies reported that CGRP enhanced excitatory transmission in the ACC. However, little is known about the possible effect of CGRP on excitatory transmission in the IC. In the present study, we investigated the role of CGRP on synaptic transmission in the IC slices of adult male mice. Bath application of CGRP produced dose-dependent potentiation of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs). This potentiation was NMDA receptor (NMDAR) independent. After application of CGRP1 receptor antagonist CGRP8–37 or BIBN 4096, CGRP produced potentiation was significantly reduced. Paired-pulse facilitation was significantly decreased by CGRP, suggesting possible presynaptic mechanisms. Consistently, bath application of CGRP significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and mEPSCs). By contrast, amplitudes of sEPSCs and mEPSCs were not significantly affected. Finally, adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1) and protein kinase A (PKA) are critical for CGRP-produced potentiation, since both selective AC1 inhibitor NB001 and the PKA inhibitor KT5720 completely blocked the potentiation.

Hildebrand,mike.hildebrand@carleton.ca,2020-03-05,"NMDA receptors are heteromeric complexes that contribute to excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. The presence of specific variants of GluN2 subunits in these complexes enables diversity in NMDA receptor function and regulation. At brain synapses, there is a switch from slow GluN2B-mediated NMDA receptors to faster GluN2A-dominated NMDA receptors as well as an increase in the ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptors during early postnatal development. This glutamate receptor switch is observed across brain regions and is critical for synaptic maturation, circuit development, and associative learning. However, whether a similar receptor subunit switch occurs within pain processing neurons in the developing spinal cord remains untested. To investigate this, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of excitatory synaptic responses from lamina II dorsal horn neurons of one to three week-old rats. We found that GluN2B and GluN2A both prominently contribute to NMDA receptor responses at neonatal lamina II synapses, with a small contribution from GluN2D as well. Surprisingly, we found that this molecular identity of NMDA receptor responses as well as the relative contribution of AMPA receptors versus NMDA receptors did not change at lamina II synapses across early postnatal development (P7 to P21). The lack of a developmental switch and persistence of slow-decaying GluN2B- and GluN2D-mediated synaptic responses throughout neuronal maturation in the dorsal horn has implications for understanding both the regulation of synaptic glutamatergic receptors as well as spinal mechanisms of pain processing.","Spinal cord, Dorsal horn, Lamina II, Synapse, NMDA receptor, GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2D, AMPA receptor, Development",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00566-9,2020

Evidence is emerging that astrocyte and neuronal primary cilia demonstrate a dichotomy in the mature mouse brain. However, it is unknown how astrocytic and neuronal primary cilia change their morphology and ciliary proteins when exposed to reactive insults including epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. We used a double transgenic mouse strain (Arl13b-mCherry; Centrin2-GFP), in which we found spontaneous seizures, and a cortical injury model to examine the morphological changes of astrocytic and neuronal primary cilia under reactive conditions. Transgenic overexpression of Arl13b drastically increases the length of astrocytic and neuronal primary cilia in the hippocampus, as well as the cilia lengths of cultured astrocytes and neurons. Spontaneous seizures shorten Arl13b-positive astrocytic cilia and AC3-positive neuronal cilia in the hippocampus. In a cortical injury model, Arl13b is not detectable in primary cilia, but Arl13b protein relocates to the cell body and has robust expression in the proximity of injured tissues. In contrast, the number of AC3-positive cilia near injured tissues remains unchanged, but their lengths become shorter. These results on astrocytic cilia implicate Arl13b in regulating astrocyte proliferation and tissue regeneration, while the shortening of AC3-positive cilia suggests adaptive changes of neuronal primary cilia under excitotoxicity.","Primary cilia, Astrocytes, Arl13b, AC3, Traumatic brain injury, Epilepsy",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00571-y,2020

AMPA receptors are Ca2+-permeable if they lack the GluA2 subunit or if GluA2 is unedited at a single nucleic acid, known as the Q/R site. In this study, we examined mice engineered with a point mutation in the intronic editing complementary sequence (ECS) of the GluA2 gene, Gria2. Mice heterozygous for the ECS mutation (named GluA2+/ECS(G)) had a ~ 20% reduction in GluA2 RNA editing at the Q/R site. We conducted an initial phenotypic analysis of these mice, finding altered current-voltage relations (confirming expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors at the synapse). Anatomically, we observed a loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons, altered dendritic morphology and reductions in CA1 pyramidal cell spine density. Behaviourally, GluA2+/ECS(G) mice exhibited reduced motor coordination, and learning and memory impairments. Notably, the mice also exhibited both NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) and vulnerability to NMDA receptor-independent seizures. These NMDA receptor-independent seizures were rescued by the Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor antagonist IEM-1460. In summary, unedited GluA2(Q) may have the potential to drive NMDA receptor-independent processes in brain function and disease. Our study provides an initial characterisation of a new mouse model for studying the role of unedited GluA2(Q) in synaptic and dendritic spine plasticity in disorders where unedited GluA2(Q), synapse loss, neurodegeneration, behavioural impairments and/or seizures are observed, such as ischemia, seizures and epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, astrocytoma, cocaine seeking behaviour and Alzheimer’s disease.","GluA2, AMPA receptors, RNA editing, Hippocampus, Seizures, Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, Long term potentiation, Synapses",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0545-1,2020

I rejected 19 out of the remaining 20 manuscripts because of insufficient raw data. Thus, more than 97% of the 41 manuscripts did not present the raw data supporting their results when requested by an editor, suggesting a possibility that the raw data did not exist from the beginning, at least in some portions of these cases.Considering that any scientific study should be based on raw data, and that data storage space should no longer be a challenge, journals, in principle, should try to have their authors publicize raw data in a public database or journal site upon the publication of the paper to increase reproducibility of the published results and to increase public trust in science.","Raw data, Data fabrication, Open data, Open science, Misconduct, Reproducibility",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0552-2,2020

Although ligand (testosterone)-dependent mutant AR aggregation has been shown to play important roles in motor neuronal degeneration by the analyses of transgenic mice models and in vitro cell culture models, the underlying disease mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated because of the discrepancy between model mice and SBMA patients. Thus, novel human disease models that recapitulate SBMA patients’ pathology more accurately are required for more precise pathophysiological analysis and the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we established disease specific iPSCs from four SBMA patients, and differentiated them into spinal motor neurons. To investigate motor neuron specific pathology, we purified iPSC-derived motor neurons using flow cytometry and cell sorting based on the motor neuron specific reporter, HB9e438::Venus, and proceeded to the genome-wide transcriptome analysis by RNA sequences. The results revealed the involvement of the pathology associated with synapses, epigenetics, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in SBMA. Notably, we demonstrated the involvement of the neuromuscular synapse via significant upregulation of Synaptotagmin, R-Spondin2 (RSPO2), and WNT ligands in motor neurons derived from SBMA patients, which are known to be associated with neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering.

NMDARs are comprised of four subunits derived from heterogeneous subunit families, yielding a complex diversity in NMDAR form and function. The quadruply-liganded state of binding of two glutamate and two glycine molecules to the receptor drives channel gating, allowing for monovalent cation flux, Ca2+ entry and the initiation of Ca2+-dependent signalling. In addition to this ionotropic function, non-ionotropic signalling can be initiated through the exclusive binding of glycine or of glutamate to the NMDAR. This binding may trigger a transmembrane conformational change of the receptor, inducing intracellular protein-protein signalling between the cytoplasmic domain and secondary messengers. In this review, we outline signalling cascades that can be activated by NMDARs and propose that the receptor transduces signalling through three parallel streams: (i) signalling via both glycine and glutamate binding, (ii) signalling via glycine binding, and (iii) signalling via glutamate binding. This variety in signal transduction mechanisms and downstream signalling cascades complements the widespread prevalence and rich diversity of NMDAR activity throughout the central nervous system and in disease pathology.","NMDA receptors, Synaptic plasticity, Ionotropic, Metabotropic, Signalling cascades, Protein kinases",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0563-z,2020

However, what changes of cortical BKCa channels undergo in the ACC remains unknown in pain-related anxiety. In the present study, a significant upregulation of synaptic and non-synaptic BKCa channel accessory β4 subunits in the ACC was accompanied with pain-associated anxiety-like behaviors in the chronic compression of multiple dorsal root ganglia (mCCD) of the rat. NS1619, an opener of BKCa channels, significantly rescued the alteration of fAHP and AP duration of ACC pyramidal neurons in mCCD rats. The mRNA expression of BKCa β4 subunits was extremely upregulated in the ACC after mCCD with the increased amount of both synaptic and non-synaptic BKCa β4 subunit protein. Meanwhile, NS1619 reversed the enhanced AMPA receptor-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency and the attenuated PPR of ACC neurons in mCCD rats. Local activation of BKCa channels in the ACC reversed mechanical allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors. These results suggest that the upregulation of postsynaptic and presynaptic BKCa β4 subunit may contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and the enhanced synaptic transmission in the ACC in neuropathic pain state, and then may result in anxiety-like behavior induced by neuropathic pain.","Anterior cingulate cortex, Anxiety, Large-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel, Excitability, Synaptic transmission",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0555-z,2020

The goal of the current study was to address the hypothesis that Aβ can be transferred via extracellular vesicles (ECVs) from brain endothelial cells to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and that this process can contribute to abnormal NPC differentiation. Mechanistically, we focused on the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and activation of the inflammasome in these events. ECVs loaded with Aβ (Aβ-ECVs) were readily taken up by NPCs and Aβ partly colocalized with the inflammasome markers ASC and NLRP3 in the nuclei of the recipient NPCs. This colocalization was affected by HIV and RAGE inhibition by a high-affinity specific inhibitor FPS-ZM1. Blocking RAGE resulted also in an increase in ECV number produced by brain endothelial cells, decreased Aβ content in ECVs, and diminished Aβ-ECVs transfer to NPC nuclei. Interestingly, both Aβ-ECVs and RAGE inhibition altered NPC differentiation. Overall, these data indicate that RAGE inhibition affects brain endothelial ECV release and Aβ-ECVs transfer to NPCs. These events may modulate ECV-mediated amyloid pathology in the HIV-infected brain and contribute to the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.","Extracellular vesicles, Blood-brain barrier, Amyloid beta, Neural progenitor cells, RAGE",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0562-0,2020

Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6, TLR4 knockout (TLR4 -KO) mice and hippocampal neurons from the two type mice were respectively divided into two groups: (1) Veh group; (2) B2M-treated group. The behavioral responses of mice were measured using Morris Water Maze. Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal damage, inflammatory response, apoptosis, synaptic proteins and neurotrophic factors, and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were examined using molecular biological or histopathological methods. The results showed that WT mice received B2M in the DG exhibited age-related cognitive declines, increased TLR4 mRNA expression and high levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and apoptotic neuronal death in the hippocampus, which were partially attenuated in TLR4-KO mice. Moreover, in absence of TLR4, B2M treatment improved hippocampus neurogenesis and increased synaptic related proteins. Our cell experiments further demonstrated that deletion of TLR4 could significantly increase synaptic related protein, decrease neuroinflammatory fators, inhibited apoptotic neuronal death, and regulated MyD88/NF-κB signal pathway after B2M treatment. In summary, our results support the TLR4 contributes to B2M-induced age-related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway via a modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic function.

Here, we evaluated the effects of SP in a mouse model of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic inflammation anxiety. SP (2.0, 10.0, 50.0 mg/kg) administration for 2 weeks dose-dependently ameliorated CFA-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the open field test and elevated plus maze test.

Additionally, the imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory receptors and neurotransmitters in the basolateral nucleus after CFA injection was also modulated by SP administration. Our findings indicate that the inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways involving anti-inflammatory activities and regulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance can be attributed to the anxiolytic effects of SP. Moreover, our molecular docking analyses show that SP also has good affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase and GABAA receptors.

However, the role of ELKS—a protein from the same family as CAST—and the synergistic roles of CAST/ELKS have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly with regard to mouse behavior. Here, we generated ELKS conditional KO in mouse forebrain synapses by crossing ELKS flox mice with a CaMKII promoter-induced Cre line. Results showed that CAST is dominant at these synapses and that ELKS can support CAST function, but is less effective in the ELKS single KO.

Anatomically, the forebrain neuronal compositions of CAST KO and CAST/ELKS double KO mice were indistinguishable, and the sensory neural network from whiskers on the face was identified as barrelette-like patches in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.

Using co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK-293 cell expression system, we found that TRPC1 and TRPC4 interacted with mGluR1a. Co-immunoprecipitation in hippocampus showed that TRPC1 interacted with mGluR1a. Using immunofluorescence, we found that TRPC1 co-localized with mGluR1a in O/A IN dendrites, whereas TRPC4 localization appeared limited to O/A IN cell body. Down-regulation of TRPC1, but not TRPC4, expression in O/A INs using small interfering RNAs prevented slow EPSCs, suggesting that TRPC1 is an obligatory TRPC subunit for these EPSCs. Our findings uncover a functional role of TRPC1 in mGluR1a-mediated slow excitatory synaptic transmission onto O/A INs that could be involved in Hebbian LTP at these synapses.","Hippocampus, GABA interneurons, TRPC subtypes, siRNA, mGluR1a-mediated slow EPSC",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0558-9,2020

After TBI, the expressions of METTL14 and FTO were significantly down-regulated in rat cerebral cortex. Using MeRIP-Seq, we identified a total of 2165 significantly changed peaks, of which 1062 were significantly up-regulated and 1103 peaks were significantly down-regulated. These m6A peaks were located across 1850 genes. The analysis of both m6A peaks and mRNA expression revealed that there were 175 mRNA significantly altered methylation and expression levels after TBI. Moreover, it was found that functional FTO is necessary to repair neurological damage caused by TBI but has no effect on the spatial learning and memory abilities of TBI rats by using FTO inhibitor FB23–2.ConclusionThis study explored the m6A methylation pattern of mRNA after TBI in rat cortex and identified FTO as possible intervention targets in the epigenetic modification of TBI.","m6A methylation, Epigenetic modification, FTO, Traumatic brain injury, Rat cortex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0554-0,2020

We found over-represented feed-forward loops (FFLs) comprising transcription factor (TF) pairs and target genes in the TRN. Using gene expression data of brain cell types, we further selected active FFLs where TF pairs and target genes were expressed in the same cell type and showed correlated temporal expression changes in the brain.

How these proteins are transported from soma to synapses, and how they become concentrated at SV clusters at presynaptic terminals were examined by immunogold electron microscopy in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons at 3–6 days in culture, a developmental stage when axonal transport of SV proteins is robust. In neuronal somas, labels for the SV integral membrane proteins (synaptophysin, SV2, VAMP/synaptobrevin, and synaptotagmin) were localized at Golgi complexes and other membranous structures that were dispersed in the cytoplasm as individual vesicle/vacuoles. These vesicles/vacuoles became aggregated in axons, with the size of aggregates ranging from 0.2 to 2 μm in length. Pleomorphic vesicle/vacuoles within the aggregate were typically larger (50–300 nm) than SVs, which were uniform in size at ~ 40 nm. These pleomorphic vesicles/vacuoles are probably transport cargos carrying SV integral membrane proteins from the soma, and then are preferentially sorted into axons at early developmental stages. Serial thin sections of young axons indicated that many labeled aggregates were not synaptic, and in fact, some of these axons were without dendritic contacts. In contrast, labels for two SV-associated proteins, synapsin I and α-synuclein, were not localized at the Golgi complexes or associated with membranous structures in the soma, but were dispersed in the cytoplasm. However, these SV-associated proteins became highly concentrated on clusters of SV-like vesicles in axons, and such clusters were already distinctive in axons as early as 3 days in culture. These clusters consisted of ~ 4–30 vesicles in single thin sections, and the vesicles were of a uniform size (~ 40 nm). Serial sectioning analysis showed that these clusters could be part of nascent synapses or exist in axons without any dendritic contact. Importantly, the vesicles were intensely labeled for SV integral membrane proteins as well as SV-associated proteins. Thus, these EM observations reveal that the two groups of proteins, SV integral membrane and SV-associated, proceed through different routes of biosynthesis and axon transport, and are only sorted into the same final compartment, SV clusters, when they are in the axons.","Electron microscopy, Axon transport, Synaptophysin, SV2, Synapsin, Active zone cytomatrix",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0549-x,2020

Evidently, synapses in sensory systems such as auditory brainstem circuits mature rapidly to achieve high-fidelity neurotransmission for sound localization. This depends on a developmental switch in AMPAR composition from slow-gating GluA1-dominant to fast-gating GluA4-dominant, but the mechanisms underlying this switch remain unknown. We hypothesize that patterned stimuli mimicking spontaneous/sound evoked activity in the early postnatal stage drives this gating switch. We examined activity-dependent changes in evoked and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs and mEPSCs) at the calyx of Held synapse by breaking through the postsynaptic membrane at different time points following 2 min of theta burst stimulation (TBS) to afferents in mouse brainstem slices. We found the decay time course of eEPSCs accelerated, but this change was not apparent until > 30 min after TBS. Histogram analyses of the decay time constants of mEPSCs for naive and tetanized synapses revealed two populations centered around τfast ≈ 0.4 and 0.8 ms, but the relative weight of the τ0.4 population over the τ0.8 population increased significantly only in tetanized synapses. Such changes are blocked by NMDAR or mGluR1/5 antagonists or inhibitors of CaMKII, PKC and protein synthesis, and more importantly precluded in GluA4−/− synapses, suggesting GluA4 is the substrate underlying the acceleration. Our results demonstrate a novel form of plasticity working through NMDAR and mGluR activation to trigger a gating switch of AMPARs with a temporally delayed onset of expression, ultimately enhancing the development of high-fidelity synaptic transmission.","Activity-dependent plasticity, Synaptic transmission, Developing plasticity, AMPAR subunit composition, Calyx of held-MNTB synapse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0536-2,2020

Here, we aimed to construct high-brightness HSV anterograde tracers by increasing the expression of exogenous genes carried by H129 viruses. Using a Trojan horse-like strategy, a HSV/AAV (adeno-associated virus) chimaera termed H8 was generated to enhance the expression of a fluorescent marker. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that the exogenous gene was efficiently replicated and amplified by the synergism of the HSV vector and introduced AAV replication system. H8 reporting fluorescence was brighter than that of currently available H129 tracers, and H8 could be used for fast and effective anterograde tracing without additional immunostaining. These results indicated that foreign gene expression in HSV tracers could be enhanced by integrating HSV with AAV replication system. This approach may be useful as a general enhanced expression strategy for HSV-based tracing tools or gene delivery vectors.","Neural circuit tracing, Anterograde tracer, Herpes simplex virus, H129, Adeno-associated virus, Trojan horse-like strategy, High-brightness",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0544-2,2020

Since oxidized proteins can be targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we investigated whether increased proteasome activity might affect the stress response in mice. Transgenic mice, expressing the N-terminally deleted version of α3 subunit (α3ΔN) of the proteasome, which has been shown to generate open-gated mutant proteasomes, in the forebrain were viable and fertile, but showed higher proteasome activity. After being challenged with CRS for 14 d, the mutant mice with hyperactive proteasomes showed significantly less immobility time in the forced swimming test compared with their wild-type littermates, suggesting that the α3ΔN transgenic mice are resistant to CRS. The accumulation of ER stress markers, such as polyubiquitin conjugates and phospho-IRE1α, was also significantly delayed in the hippocampus of the mutants. Notably, α3ΔN mice exhibited little deficits in other behavioral tasks, suggesting that stress resilience is likely due to the degradation of misfolded proteins by the open-gated proteasomes. These data strongly indicate that not only is the proteasome a critical modulator of stress response in vivo but also a possible therapeutic target for reducing chronic stress.","Proteasome, Gate, Chronic stress, Depression-like behavior, Oxidative stress",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0548-y,2020

Biochemical approaches such as immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and surface biotinylation were conducted to support data.ResultsWe found that the altered MLC1 expression and localization led to a great alteration in cellular morphology and motility through actin remodeling. MLC1 overexpression induced filopodia formation and suppressed motility. And, MLC1 proteins expressed in patient-derived MLC1 mutants resulted in trapping in the ER although no changes in morphology or motility were observed.

RelB deficiency may cause a variety of immunological disorders in both mice and humans. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system which involves a board of immune cell populations. Thereby, RelB may exert an impact on MS by modulating the functions of dendritic cells and the differentiation of T cells and B cells. Despite intensive research, the role of RelB in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, is still unclear.

The levels of active, phosphorylated signalling molecules associated with the IR/Akt/mTOR pathway were measured with the multiplex fluorescent immunoassay.ResultsWhen significant mitochondrial depolarisations occurred due to glutamate-evoked massive influxes of Ca2+ into the cells, insulin induced 48% less activation of the IR (assessed by IR tyrosine phosphorylation, pY1150/1151), 72% less activation of Akt (assessed by Akt serine phosphorylation, pS473), 44% less activation of mTOR (assessed by mTOR pS2448), and 38% less inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK3β) (assessed by GSK3β pS9) compared with respective controls.

Amygdala is one of the kernel brain regions mediating stress-coping in the brain. However, little is known about whether early life stress may affect amygdala to have its inoculative effect. Here, we observed that moderate maternal separation (MS) from postnatal day 3 to day 21 (D3–21, 1 h per day) significantly alleviated the increased anxiety-like behavior induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in adulthood, suggesting an obvious inoculative effect of moderate MS. Further studies revealed that MS prevented CSDS-evoked augmentation of glutamatergic transmission onto principal neurons (PNs) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) by inhibiting presynaptic glutamate release. By contrast, it did not affect GABAergic transmission in BLA PNs, as indicated by unaltered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Moreover, the CSDS-induced increase of neuronal excitability was also mitigated by MS in BLA PNs. In conclusion, our results suggest that MS may have its inoculative effect through alleviating the influences of later life stress on the glutamatergic transmission and neuronal activity in amygdala neurons.","Moderate maternal separation, Stress inoculation, Amygdala, Anxiety, Glutamatergic transmission, Excitability",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0534-4,2019

However, the molecular mechanism underlying activity-dependent fine-scale topography is not well known. Studies in the Drosophila visual system have demonstrated that cell-adhesion molecules direct fine-scale topography, but whether or not these molecules are involved in activity-dependent fine-scale topography remains to be determined. We previously reported that the nociceptors in Drosophila larvae form an activity-dependent fine-scale topographic system. The establishment of this system is instructed by the level of neuronal activity in individual nociceptors. Here, we show that the atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi) is required for establishing the nociceptor topographic map. We found that the topographic defect caused by loss of fmi was epistatic to the inhibition of neuronal activity and the overexpression of the activity-regulated gene Trim9. These results suggest that Fmi and neuronal activity interact to regulate fine-scale topography.

However, the existence of AHN in humans, particularly in elderly individuals, remains to be determined. Recently, several studies reported that neural progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature neurons were detected in the hippocampus of elderly humans, based on the expressions of putative markers for these cells, claiming that this provides evidence of the persistence of AHN in humans. Herein, we briefly overview the phenomenon that we call “dematuration,” in which mature neurons dedifferentiate to a pseudo-immature status and re-express the molecular markers of neural progenitor cells and immature neurons. Various conditions can easily induce dematuration, such as inflammation and hyper-excitation of neurons, and therefore, the markers for neural progenitor cells and immature neurons may not necessarily serve as markers for AHN. Thus, the aforementioned studies have not presented definitive evidence for the persistence of hippocampal neurogenesis throughout adult life in humans, and we would like to emphasize that those markers should be used cautiously when presented as evidence for AHN. Increasing AHN has been considered as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, given that immature neuronal markers can be re-expressed in mature adult neurons, independent of AHN, in various disease conditions including AD, strategies to increase the expression of these markers in the DG may be ineffective or may worsen the symptoms of such diseases.","Hippocampus, Dentate gyrus, Granule cells, Dematuration, Adult neurogenesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0522-8,2019

We show that metabolome patterns in peripheral blood could retrospectively predict the locomotor activity levels. We longitudinally monitored locomotor activity in the home cage, and subsequently collected peripheral blood and performed metabolomic analyses. We then constructed cross-validated linear regression models based on blood metabolome patterns to predict locomotor activity levels of individual mice. Our analysis revealed a significant correlation between actual and predicted activity levels, indicative of successful predictions. Pathway analysis of metabolites used for successful predictions showed enrichment in mitochondria metabolism-related terms, such as “Warburg effect” and “citric acid cycle.” In addition, we found that peripheral blood metabolome patterns predicted expression levels of genes implicated in bipolar disorder in the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for mood regulation, suggesting that the brain–periphery axis is related to mood-change-associated behaviors.

More than 20 years of multidisciplinary studies have shown that brain zinc dyshomeostasis may play a critical role in AD progression, which provides encouraging clues for metal-targeted therapies in the treatment of AD. Unfortunately, the pilot clinical application of zinc chelator and/or ionophore strategy, such as the use of quinoline-based compounds, namely clioquinol and PBT2, has not yet been successful. The emerging findings revealed a list of key zinc transporters whose mRNA or protein levels were abnormally altered at different stages of AD brains. Furthermore, specifically modulating the expression of some of the zinc transporters in the central nervous system through genetic methods slowed down or prevented AD progression in animal models, resulting in significantly improved cognitive performance, movement, and prolonged lifespan. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it shed new light on the treatment or prevention of the disease. This review considers recent advances regarding AD, zinc and zinc transporters, recapitulating their relationships in extending our current understanding of the disease amelioration effects of zinc transport proteins as potential therapeutic targets to cure AD, and it may also provide new insights to identify novel therapeutic strategies for ageing and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease.","Zinc transporter, Brain, Genetic modulation, Emerging therapeutic target, Alzheimer’s disease, Ageing",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0528-2,2019

We have recently reported that male mice subjected to spared injury of the sciatic nerve undergo changes in the function of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that culminate in reduced output of layer 5 pyramidal cells. More recently, we have shown that this is mediated by alterations in synaptic inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) into GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC. Optogenetic inhibition of these inputs reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in male mice. It is known that the processing of pain signals can exhibit marked sex differences. We therefore tested whether the dysregulation of BLA to mPFC signaling is equally altered in female mice. Injection of AAV-Arch3.0 constructs into the BLA followed by implantation of a fiberoptic cannula into the mPFC in sham and SNI operated female mice was carried out, and pain behavioral responses were measured in response to yellow light mediated activation of this inhibitory opsin. Our data reveal that Arch3.0 activation leads to a marked increase in paw withdrawal thresholds and latencies in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli, respectively. However, we did not observe nerve injury-induced changes in mPFC layer 5 pyramidal cell output in female mice.

Many familial ALS patients harbor autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the RNA/DNA binding protein ‘fused in sarcoma’ (FUS) commonly inducing its cytoplasmic mislocalization. Recent reports from our group and others demonstrate a role of FUS in maintaining genome integrity and the DNA damage response (DDR). FUS interacts with many DDR proteins and may regulate their recruitment at damage sites. Given the role of FUS in RNA transactions, here we explore whether FUS also regulates the expression of DDR factors. We performed RT2 PCR arrays for DNA repair and DDR signaling pathways in CRISPR/Cas9 FUS knockout (KO) and shRNA mediated FUS knockdown (KD) cells, which revealed significant (> 2-fold) downregulation of BRCA1, DNA ligase 4, MSH complex and RAD23B. Importantly, similar perturbations in these factors were also consistent in motor neurons differentiated from an ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line with a FUS-P525L mutation, as well as in postmortem spinal cord tissue of sporadic ALS patients with FUS pathology. BRCA1 depletion has been linked to neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) accumulation and cognitive defects. The ubiquitin receptor RAD23 functions both in nucleotide excision repair and proteasomal protein clearance pathway and is thus linked to neurodegeneration. Together, our study suggests that the FUS pathology perturbs DDR signaling via both its direct role and the effect on the expression of DDR genes.

Through their broad implication in neurodegenerative diseases, molecules involved in these genetic pathways, in particular those involved in autophagy, are emerging as appealing therapeutic targets for intervention in neurodegeneration.","Autophagy, Endo-lysosome, Mitophagy, Neurodegeneration",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0504-x,2019

However, results from previous studies examining the association between common variants of FKBP5 and stress have been inconsistent. To investigate whether the loss of FKBP5 affects the stress response, we examined the behavior of mice following the induction of chronic restraint stress between homozygous wild-type and Fkbp5 knock-out mice. After 21 days of exposure to restraint stress, WT mice showed anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, which could be measured by a sucrose preference test. However, Fkbp5-deficient mice did not exhibit significant depressive-like behavior compared to the WT after exposure to chronic restraint stress. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying stress resilience, we performed RNA sequencing analysis. The differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that chronic stress induced changes in various biological processes involved in cell-cell adhesion and inflammatory response. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 60 characteristic modules that correlated with stress or the FKBP5 genotype. Among them, M55 showed a gene expression pattern consistent with behavioral changes after stress exposure, and the gene ontology analysis revealed that this was involved in nervous system development, gland morphogenesis, and inflammatory response. These results suggest that FKBP5 may be a crucial factor for the stress response, and that transcriptomic data can provide insight into stress-related pathophysiology.","FKBP5, Chronic stress, Resilience, RNAseq, WGCNA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0521-9,2019

Electrophysiological analyses revealed that both channel isoforms exhibit DAMGO-induced voltage-dependent (Gβγ-mediated) inhibition and its recovery by voltage pre-pulses, as well as a voltage-independent component. However, the two channel isoforms differ in their relative extent of voltage-dependent and independent inhibition, with Cav2.2-37b showing significantly more voltage-dependent inhibition upon activation of the three mMOR receptors studied. In addition, coexpression of either mMOR1 or mMOR1C results in an agonist-independent reduction in the peak current density of Cav2.2-37a channels, whereas the peak current density of Cav2.2-37b does not appear to be affected. Interestingly, this decrease is not due to an effect on channel expression at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by biotinylation experiments. We further examined the mechanism underlying the agonist-independent modulation of Cav2.2-37a by mMOR1C. Incubation of cells with pertussis toxin did not affect the mMOR1C mediated inhibition of Cav2.2-37a currents, indicating a lack of involvement of Gi/o signaling. However, when a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor was applied, the effect of mMOR1C was lost. Moreover, when we recorded currents using a Cav2.2-37a mutant in which tyrosine 1747 was replaced with phenylalanine (Y1747F), the agonist independent effects of mMOR1C were abolished. Altogether our findings show that Cav2.2-37a and Cav2.2-37b isoforms are subject to differential regulation by C-terminal splice variants of mMORs, and that constitutive mMOR1C activity and downstream tyrosine kinase activity exert a selective inhibition of the Cav2.2-37a splice variant, an N-type channel isoform that is highly enriched in nociceptors.

To evaluate the role of KIF5, conventional kinesin, in the dendritic transport of PSD-95 protein, we expressed a transport defective form of KIF5A (ΔMD) that does not contain the N-terminal motor domain. Expression of ΔMD significantly decreased PSD-95 level in the dendrites. Consistently, KIF5 was associated with PSD-95 in in vitro and in vivo assays. This interaction was mediated by the C-terminal tail regions of KIF5A and the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. Additionally, the ADPDZ3 (the association domain of NMDA receptor and PDZ3 domain) expression significantly reduced the levels of PSD-95, glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) in dendrites. The association between PSD-95 and KIF5A was dose-dependent on Staufen protein, suggesting that the Staufen plays a role as a regulatory role in the association.

Recent studies using mouse models of RASopathies demonstrated that particular mutations associated with each disorder disrupt CNS development in a mutation-specific manner.

EFMR is also often associated with autism-like symptoms. In mice and humans, epilepsy occurs only in heterozygous females who have a mixture of PCDH19 wild-type (WT) and mutant cells caused by random X-inactivation; it does not occur in hemizygous PCDH19 mutant males. This unique inheritance pattern strongly suggests the underlying disease mechanism operates via interference between WT and mutant cells rather than being a result of complete loss of PCDH19 functions. Although it remains unclear whether the other symptoms of EFMR also conform to this unique genotype-phenotype relationship, PCDH19 mutant males were recently reported to demonstrate autism-like symptoms. We, therefore, used a Pcdh19 knockout (KO) mouse model to ask whether a complete lack of PCDH19 causes autism-like behaviors. Consistent with the autism observed in EFMR females, we found Pcdh19 heterozygous KO female mice (with mosaic expression of PCDH19) show defects in sociability in the 3-chamber test. Surprisingly, hemizygous Pcdh19 KO male mice (without any PCDH19 expression) exhibit impaired sociability in the 3-chamber test and reduced social interactions in the reciprocal social interaction test. We also observed that, compared to WT mice, mutant mice display more repetitive behaviors, including self-grooming and rearing.

Here, we use knockout (KO) mice to show the role of GAREM2, that is highly expressed in the brain. According to the comprehensive behavioral battery, they exhibited less anxiety both in elevated plus maze and open field tests, mildly increased social approaching behavior in the reciprocal social interaction test, and longer latency to immobility in the tail suspension test as compared to wild-type (WT). Additionally, the extension of neurites in the primary cultured neurons was suppressed in ones derived from GAREM2 KO mice. Furthermore, we also identified Intersectin, as a binding partner of GAREM2 in this study. Intersectin is also a multi-domain adaptor protein that regulates endocytosis and cell signaling, which can potentially alter the subcellular localization of GAREM2. The important molecules, such as the neurotrophin receptor and Erk family, that are involved in the signaling pathway of the neural cell growth in the mouse brain, have been reported to participate in emotional behavior. As GAREM plays a role in the cellular growth factor receptor signaling pathway, GAREM2 may have a common role related to the transduction of Erk signaling in the higher brain functions.","Adaptor protein, Tyrosine phosphorylation, Behavior tests, Neuron, Knockout mouse, Brain function",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0512-x,2019

The GABRA1 (R214C) variant was identified using whole exome sequencing, and the pathogenic effect of this mutation was investigated by comparing wild-type (WT) α1 and R214C α1 GABAA receptor-expressing HEK cells. GABA-evoked currents in these cells were recorded using whole-cell, outside-out macro-patch and cell-attached single-channel patch-clamp recordings. Changes to surface and total protein expression levels of WT α1 and R214C α1 were quantified using surface biotinylation assay and western blotting, respectively. Finally, potential therapeutic options were explored by determining the effects of modulators, including diazepam, insulin, and verapamil, on channel gating and receptor trafficking of WT and R214C GABAA receptors. We found that the GABRA1 (R214C) variant decreased whole-cell GABA-evoked currents by reducing single channel open time and both surface and total GABAA receptor expression levels. The GABA-evoked currents in R214C GABAA receptors could only be partially restored with benzodiazepine (diazepam) and insulin. However, verapamil treatment for 24 h fully restored the function of R214C mutant receptors, primarily by increasing channel open time. We conclude that the GABRA1 (R214C) variant reduces channel activity and surface expression of mutant receptors, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of genetic EE. The functional restoration by verapamil suggests that it is a potentially new therapeutic option for patients with the R214C variant and highlights the value of precision medicine in the treatment of genetic EEs.","GABA a receptor, Epileptic encephalopathy, Mutation, Therapeutic options",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0513-9,2019

Ultimately, we detected significantly increased [1-13C]lactate conversion in the whole brain and an almost five-fold increased [1-13C]lactate/pyruvate ratio in the hippocampal region. In the present study, we induced diabetes in mice by injecting streptozotocin and feeding them an HFD for 6 months. Unlike in prediabetic mice, [1-13C]lactate conversion in the diabetic mice did not differ from that in the control group, but [1-13C]lactate/total 13C ratio showed an almost 1.4-fold increase in the hippocampal region. We measured the amount of the lactate and mRNA levels of glucose transporters from isolated hippocampus and cortex samples. In the hippocampus, significantly decreased GLUT1 mRNA levels and increased lactate were detected, suggesting an inconsistency between glucose and pyruvate metabolism. Pyruvate can be produced from oxaloacetate as well as glucose. We investigated ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) because it cleaves citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA. Phosphorylated ACLY (Ser455), the active form, was increased in both hippocampus and cortex samples of mice injected with streptozotocin and fed an HFD. Also, phosphorylated ACLY/total ACLY showed a positive correlation with lactate amount in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that the brain has different responses to diabetic progression, but, in the hippocampus, maintains metabolic alteration toward increasing lactate production from the prediabetic to the diabetic stage.

The hippocampus (Hipp) is a brain region involved in cognition and memory, and the neuropeptide orexin has been shown to enhance learning and memory. Previous studies show impairments in Hipp-dependent memory in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (A53T mice), and we hypothesized that increasing orexin tone will reverse this. To test this, we subjected 3, 5, and 7-month old A53T mice to a Barnes maze and a contextual object recognition test to determine Hipp dependent memory. Inflammation and astrogliosis markers in the Hipp were assessed by immuno-fluorescence densitometry. The data show that early cognitive impairment is coupled with an increase in expression of inflammatory and astrogliosis markers. Next, in two separate experiments, mice were given intra-hippocampal injections of orexin or chemogenetic viral injections of an orexin neuron specific Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD). For the pharmacological approach mice were intracranially treated with orexin A, whereas the chemogenetic approach utilized clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Both pharmacological orexin A intervention as well as chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons ameliorated Hipp-dependent early memory impairment observed in A53T mice.

Adult C57BL/6 J mice were placed in running wheels and allowed for voluntary running 2 weeks. Myelin levels in the central nervous system were detected using western blotting, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and electron microscopy. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLs) were detected using immunohistochemical staining and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays. Motor abilities of the animals were examined using open-field, rotarod running, and beam-walking behavioral paradigms. Vital molecules of Wnt signaling were detected, and the involvement of such molecules was verified using in vitro culture of OPCs. Our results showed that VWR significantly enhanced the myelination in the motor cortex. VWR promoted the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, and the maturation of OLs. The VWR-regulated myelination was associated with the improved motor skill and decreased mRNA level of Wnt3a/9a, whereas stimulation of Wnt signaling pathway with Wnt3a or Wnt9a suppressed OPCs proliferation and differentiation in vitro.

We used the invariant synaptic connectivity patterns of Drosophila mechanosensory neurons with their innate cleaning reflex responses as readouts for errors in synaptic targeting and circuit function. FGFR loss of function resulted in a decrease in axonal branch number and lengths, and overexpression of FGFRs resulted in ectopic branches and increased lengths. FGFR mutants produced stereotyped axonal targeting errors.

It is usually expressed in immune cells and has recently been identified to distribute in the nervous system and play critical roles in various neurological disorders. Presently, the impacts of FcγRI in neuropathic pain was largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the impacts of FcγRI in neuropathic pain through pain-related neurobehavioral studies and underlying mechanisms by biochemical methods in animal and cell models. Specifically, we first utilized the chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model that displayed neuropathic pain related symptoms and signs, including thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. These neurobehavioral defects were significantly attenuated by the anti-FcγRI antibody, which was associated with reduced levels of neuropeptide substance P, C3, and TNF-α. Furthermore, we validated our animal findings using the embryonically neural crest-originated PC12 cell model. We found that stimulation of the IgG immune complex led to increased levels of FcγRI and inflammatory mediators, which were attenuated by the anti-FcγRI antibody in these cells. Collectively, our results from animal and cell-based studies suggest that FcγRI is a critical player for peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain by mediating pain-related immunological events, which therefore may provide a new therapeutic target for protection against chronic pain.","Neuropathic pain, Fc gamma receptor, Anti-FcγRI antibody, Spinal cord, Peripheral nerve injury, Inflammatory mediators",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0499-3,2019

The Cacna1b gene encodes the α1-pore forming subunit of CaV2.2 channels. Distinct subsets of splice variants of CaV2.2 derived from cell-specific alternative splicing of the Cacna1b pre-mRNA are expressed in specific subpopulations of neurons. Four cell-specific sites of alternative splicing in Cacna1b that alter CaV2.2 channel function have been described in detail: three cassette exons (e18a, e24a, and e31a) and a pair of mutually exclusive exons (e37a/e37b). Cacna1b mRNAs containing e37a are highly enriched in a subpopulation of nociceptors where they influence nociception and morphine analgesia. E37a-Cacna1b mRNAs are also expressed in brain, but their cell-specific expression in this part of the nervous system, their functional consequences in central synapses and their role on complex behavior have not been studied. In this report, we show that e37a-Cacna1b mRNAs are expressed in excitatory projection neurons where CaV2.2 channels are known to influence transmitter release at excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate gyrus (DG). By comparing behaviors of WT mice to those that only express e37b-CaV2.2 channels, we found evidence that e37a-CaV2.2 enhances behavioral responses to aversive stimuli.

There was a significant upregulation in the expression of Gpx4 and Acsl4 at 6 h, Slc7a11 from 12 h to 72 h, and Nox2 and Sat1 from 6 h to 72 h post injury. Similarly, an upregulation in the expression of Gpx4 at 6 h, Nox2 from 6 h to 72 h, xCT from 12 h to 72 h, and Sat1 at 72 h after CCI was observed at the protein level. Interestingly, MDA and ferrous ion were increased whereas miR-212-5p was decreased in the CCI group compared to the sham group. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-212-5p attenuated ferroptosis while downregulation of miR-212-5p promoted ferroptotic cell death partially by targeting prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (Ptgs2) in HT-22 and Neuro-2a cell lines.

Next, we tested for the effect of F1 on the expression level of key molecules involved in learning and memory. Results from Western blot assay revealed that an abnormally reduced level of a phosphorylated form of CREB in the hippocampus of AD mice was restored to a normal level by F1 administration.

This study was designed to examine the role of anterior insular cortex (aIC) in the pathogenesis of hyperalgesia in a rat model of CP. CP was induced by intraductal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Abdomen hyperalgesia and anxiety were assessed by von Frey filament and open field tests, respectively. Two weeks after surgery, the activation of aIC was indicated by FOS immunohistochemical staining and electrophysiological recordings. Expressions of VGluT1, NMDAR subunit NR2B and AMPAR subunit GluR1 were analyzed by immunoblottings. The regulatory roles of aIC in hyperalgesia and pain-related anxiety were detected via pharmacological approach and chemogenetics in CP rats. Our results showed that TNBS treatment resulted in long-term hyperalgesia and anxiety-like behavior in rats. CP rats exhibited increased FOS expression and potentiated excitatory synaptic transmission within aIC. CP rats also showed up-regulated expression of VGluT1, and increased membrane trafficking and phosphorylation of NR2B and GluR1 within aIC. Blocking excitatory synaptic transmission significantly attenuated abdomen mechanical hyperalgesia. Specifically inhibiting the excitability of insular pyramidal cells reduced both abdomen hyperalgesia and pain-related anxiety. In conclusion, our findings emphasize a key role for aIC in hyperalgesia and anxiety of painful CP, providing a novel insight into cortical modulation of painful CP and shedding light on aIC as a potential target for neuromodulation interventions in the treatment of CP.","Rat, Chronic pancreatitis, Anterior insular cortex, Long-term potentiation, Excitatory synaptic transmission, Hyperalgesia, Anxiety",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0497-5,2019

Here we report that wildtype AnkB increased overall Cav2.1 levels without impacting surface Cav2.1 levels in HEK293T cells. An AnkB variant, p.S646F, which we recently discovered to be associated with seizures, further increased overall Cav2.1 levels, again with no impact on surface Cav2.1 levels. AnkB p.Q879R, on the other hand, increased surface Cav2.1 levels in the presence of accessory subunits α2δ1 and β4. Additionally, AnkB p.E1458G decreased surface Cav2.1 irrespective of the presence of accessory subunits. In addition, we found that partial deletion of AnkB in cortex resulted in a decrease in overall Cav2.1 levels, with no change to the levels of Cav2.1 detected in synaptosome fractions. Our work suggests that depending on the particular variant, AnkB regulates intracellular and surface Cav2.1. Notably, expression of the AnkB variant associated with seizure (AnkB p.S646F) caused further increase in intracellular Cav2.1 levels above that of even wildtype AnkB.

This study focused on investigating the influence of Nsun5 deficiency in the development of cerebral cortex. In comparison with wild-type littermates, the cortical thickness in postnatal day 10 Nsun5-KO mice was obviously reduced with an abnormal laminar organization, and the processes of pyramidal cells were shorter and finer. Nsun5 was selectively expressed in radial glial cells (RGCs) of cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 12.5 to E16.5, but not in intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) or neocortical neurons. The Nsun5 deletion did not alter proliferation of RGCs or differentiation of RGCs into IPCs. Notably, the ablation of Nsun5 disrupted the growth of radial glial scaffolds, thus numerous basal processes of RGCs failed to reach pial basement membrane. Level of cell polarity regulator Cdc42 protein in radial glial scaffolds of E14.5 Nsun5-KO mice was reduced, but the level of Cdc42 mRNA was unchanged. The dysfunction of glial scaffolds impeded the radial migration of upper-layer and deeper-layer neurons to cause their subcortical accumulation and apoptosis, resulting in an obvious thinness of the cortical plate in E18.5 Nsun5-KO mice. These findings establish a critical role of Nsun5 in development of cerebral cortex through regulating radial glial scaffolds of RGCs to control migration of neocortical neurons.","Cerebral cortex, Migrating neurons, Nsun5, Radial glial cells (RGCs), Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0496-6,2019

These changes, with stress before pregnancy, are potential risk factors for the development of postpartum depression (PPD). A valid animal model of PPD is needed to understand the neurobiological basis of the depressive state of females. To explore a mouse model of PPD, we first assessed anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in nulliparous (virgin), nonlactating primiparous, and lactating primiparous females in four inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, C57BL/6JJcl, BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj, and BALB/cAJcl).

Second, we investigated the additional effects of prepregnancy stress (restraint stress for 6 h/day for 21 days) on postpartum behaviors in the BALB/cAJcl strain. We found that females of the two BALB/c substrains showed decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors compared with females of the two C57BL/6 substrains. Behavioral differences were also observed between the two substrains of each strain. Additionally, pregnancy- and lactation-dependent behavioral differences were found in some strains: lactating BALB/cAJcl females traveled shorter distance than the females of the other reproductive state groups, while nonlactating and lactating BALB/cAJcl and C57BL/6J females showed increased depression-related behavior compared with nulliparous females. Lactating BALB/cAJcl and C57BL/6JJcl females exhibited decreased sucrose preference or anhedonia-like behavior compared with nulliparous and nonlactating females, although these results did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. An additional independent experiment replicated the marked behavioral changes in lactating BALB/cAJcl females. Moreover, increased anxiety-like behavior was observed in lactating BALB/cAJcl females that experienced prepregnancy stress. These results suggest genetic contributions to the regulation of anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in female mice. Furthermore, this study suggests that pregnancy and lactation cause decreased locomotor activity and increased depression-related behaviors, which was consistently found in our results, and that prepregnancy stress enhances anxiety-like behavior in the BALB/cAJcl strain.

Chronic FLX treatment reportedly induces cellular responses in the brain, including increased adult hippocampal and cortical neurogenesis and reversal of neuron maturation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. However, because most previous studies have used rodent models, it remains unclear whether these FLX-induced changes occur in the primate brain. To evaluate the effects of FLX in the primate brain, we used immunohistological methods to assess neurogenesis and the expression of neuronal maturity markers following chronic FLX treatment (3 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) in adult marmosets (n = 3 per group). We found increased expression of doublecortin and calretinin, markers of immature neurons, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of FLX-treated marmosets. Further, FLX treatment reduced parvalbumin expression and the number of neurons with perineuronal nets, which indicate mature fast-spiking interneurons, in the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala or cerebral cortex. We also found that FLX treatment increased the generation of cortical interneurons; however, significant up-regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was not observed in FLX-treated marmosets.

Recent studies have shown that the forgetting of contextual fear memory is promoted via increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis induced by neurogenesis enhancers, such as memantine (MEM) and exercise, raising the possibility that neurogenesis enhancers improve PTSD by facilitating the forgetting of traumatic memory. On the other hand, repeated exposure to social defeat (SD) stress by aggressor mice induces social avoidance behavior to the aggressor and chronic anxiety-like behavior. In this study, we assumed this SD stress paradigm as a PTSD-like model and examined the effects of treatment with neurogenesis enhancer MEM on SD stress-induced PTSD-like behavior. Male C57BL/6 mice received SD stress for 10 consecutive days and were assessed for social avoidance memory to the aggressor (memory of aggressor mice) and anxiety-like behavior using social interaction and elevated zero maze tasks. Consistent with previous studies, SD mice formed social avoidance memory and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, subsequent MEM treatment (once a week for 4 weeks) significantly reduced social avoidance behavior, suggesting that MEM-treated SD mice showed forgetting of social avoidance memory. Interestingly, MEM-treated SD mice showed comparable anxiety-like behavior with control mice that were not exposed to SD stress. Moreover, MEM-treated SD mice showed no reinstatement of social avoidance memory following single re-exposure to the aggressor. Our findings suggest that neurogenesis enhancer not only enhanced the forgetting of traumatic memory but also improved PTSD (anxiety)-like behavior.","PTSD, Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, Social defeat, Forgetting, Anxiety-like behavior",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0488-6,2019

However, the role of LIMK signaling in brain development remains unknown. In this study, we used LIMK1 KO and LIMK2 KO mice to investigate the role of LIMK signaling in the cerebral cortical development. We found that these KO mice are reduced in the number of pyramidal neurons in upper cortical layers and this reduction is accompanied by a smaller pool of neural progenitor cells and impaired neuronal migration.

While we have previously demonstrated that R18 can reduce excitotoxicity-induced neuronal calcium influx, other molecular events associated with R18 neuroprotection are yet to investigated. Therefore, in this study we were particularly interested in protein expression changes in R18 treated neurons subjected to excitotoxicity.Proteomic analysis was used to compare protein expression patterns in primary cortical neuronal cultures subjected to: (i) R18-treatment alone (R18); (ii) glutamic acid excitotoxic injury (Glut); (iii) R18-treatment and glutamic acid injury (R18 + Glut); (iv) no treatment (Cont). Whole cell lysates were harvested 24 h post-injury and subjected to quantitative proteomic analysis (iTRAQ), coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and subsequent bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).Relative to control cultures, R18, Glut, and R18 + Glut treatment resulted in the detection of 5, 95 and 14 DEPs respectively. Compared to Glut alone, R18 + Glut revealed 98 DEPs, including 73 proteins whose expression was also altered by treatment with Glut and/or R18 alone, as well as 25 other uniquely regulated proteins. R18 treatment reversed the up- or down-regulation of all 73 Glut-associated DEPs, which included proteins involved in mitochondrial integrity, ATP generation, mRNA processing and protein translation. Analysis of protein-protein interactions of the 73 DEPs showed they were primarily associated with mitochondrial respiration, proteasome activity and protein synthesis, transmembrane trafficking, axonal growth and neuronal differentiation, and carbohydrate metabolism. Identified protein pathways associated with proteostasis and energy metabolism, and with pathways involved in neurodegeneration.Collectively, the findings indicate that R18 neuroprotection following excitotoxicity is associated with preservation of neuronal protein profiles, and differential protein expression that assists in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, protein homeostasis, and membrane trafficking.Graphical abstract","Poly-arginine-18 (R18), iTRAQ proteomics, Neuroprotection, Mito-protection, Excitotoxicity, Stroke",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0486-8,2019

We show that FMRP is required for translation downstream of NMDAR stimulation and MOV10 is the key specificity factor in this process. In rat cortical synaptoneurosomes, MOV10 in association with FMRP and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) forms the inhibitory complex on a subset of NMDAR responsive mRNAs. On NMDAR stimulation, MOV10 dissociates from AGO2 and promotes the translation of its target mRNAs. FMRP is required to form MOV10-AGO2 inhibitory complex and to promote translation of MOV10 associated mRNAs. Phosphorylation of FMRP appears to be the potential switch for NMDAR mediated translation and in the absence of FMRP, the distinct translation response to NMDAR stimulation is lost.

We found that the phosphorylation sites were highly proline directed and primarily mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) dependent, due to particular activation of c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), a member of the MAPK family. Because the MAPK/JNK pathway is also involved in axon regeneration of invertebrate model organisms such Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, we performed evolutionary bioinformatics analysis of the mammalian growth cone phosphorylation sites. Although these sites were generally conserved within vertebrates, they were not necessarily conserved in these invertebrate model organisms. In particular, high-frequency phosphorylation sites (> 20 times) were less conserved than low-frequency sites. Taken together, the mammalian growth cones contain a large number of vertebrate-specific phosphorylation sites and stronger dependence upon MAPK/JNK than C. elegans or Drosophila.

Our results further show that fragile-X mental retardation protein FMRP inhibits the translational activity of human ortholog Netrin-1 (NTN1). Knock-down of NetB significantly rescues the MB defects and ameliorates deficits in the learning and memory in FXS model Drosophila. These results indicate a critical role for NetB in MB lobe extension and identify NetB as a novel target of FMRP which contributes to learning and memory.","Mushroom body (MB), Netrin-B (NetB), Axon extension, Fragile X syndrome (FXS)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0472-1,2019

This study aimed to identify miRNAs that are differently expressed in plasma samples of PD patients, MSA patients, and healthy controls. We used microarray analysis to screen for miRNAs that are up- and down-regulated in these patients and analyzed the relative-quantitative expression levels of the identified miRNAs by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

We observed increased Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in BBS mouse brains. Increased GFAP expression is a hallmark of astrocyte reactivity that is associated with microglia activation and neuro-inflammation. To gain a better understanding of reactive astrocytes observed in BBS mice, we used two mouse models of BBS8, a BBSome protein, to characterize the reactive astrocyte phenotype. The finding of reactive astrocytes in young BBS mouse brains led us to hypothesize that loss of BBSome function leads to reactive astrocytes prior to hydrocephalus and obesity. By using two mouse models of BBS8, a congenital BBS8 knockout with hydrocephalus, and a tamoxifen-inducible BBS8 knockout without hydrocephalus, we were able to molecularly phenotype the reactive astrocytes. Molecular phenotype of reactive astrocytes shows differential regulation of inducers of Pan, A1 neurotoxic, and A2 neuroprotective astrocytes that are significantly altered in brains of both congenital and induced knockouts of BBS8, but without microglia activation. We find evidence for neuroinflammation in the brains of congenital knockout mice, but not in induced knockout mice. Protein levels of GFAP, SERPINA3N and post-synaptic density 95 (PSD95) are significantly increased in congenital knockout mice, but remain unchanged in induced knockout mice. Thus, despite the reactive astrocyte phenotype being present in both models, the molecular signature of reactive astrocytes in BBS8 mice models are distinct. Together, these findings suggest that BBS8, and by extension the BBSome, plays a role in neuro-astrocyte functions independent of hydrocephalus, and its dysregulation is associated with astrocyte reactivity without microglia activation.

BrdU staining showed that survival of newborn neurons was reduced, while there were fewer BrdU-positive neurons in the HDBR group compared with the control. Furthermore, IdU-positive neurons also decreased in the HDBR group suggesting a reduced proliferation capacity for these newborn neurons.

These structural changes were reversible upon returning the samples to control medium for 5–10 min. Thus, the postsynaptic density is a very dynamic structure that undergoes rapid reorganization of its components upon stimulation, and recovery upon cessation of stimulation.

AD develops over decades but detailed molecular analysis of AD brains is limited to postmortem tissue where the stresses initiating the disease may be obscured by compensatory responses and neurodegenerative processes. Rare, dominant mutations in a small number of genes, but particularly the gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), drive early onset of familial AD (EOfAD). Numerous transgenic models of AD have been constructed in mouse and other organisms, but transcriptomic analysis of these models has raised serious doubts regarding their representation of the disease state. Since we lack clarity regarding the molecular mechanism(s) underlying AD, we posit that the most valid approach is to model the human EOfAD genetic state as closely as possible. Therefore, we sought to analyse brains from zebrafish heterozygous for a single, EOfAD-like mutation in their PSEN1-orthologous gene, psen1. We previously introduced an EOfAD-like mutation (Q96_K97del) into the endogenous psen1 gene of zebrafish.

Different from unpredictable chronic stress, which is a well-established animal model for depression, predictable chronic mild stress (PCMS), a routine stress experienced in day-to-day life, has been demonstrated to improve mood and memory. In the present study, we assess the effects of PCMS (5 min of daily restrain stress for 4 weeks) on depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and pyrin domain containing three (NLRP3) activation in hippocampus of mice subjected to peripheral immune challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that PCMS facilitated the recovery from LPS-induced depressive- or anxiety-like behavior. Concurrent with the reversal of abnormal behavioral changes, PCMS suppressed LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression, microglia activation, and oxidative stress in hippocampus. Correspondingly, PCMS inhibited LPS-induced overactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) maturation. Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) signaling was demonstrated to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome overactivation and oxidative stress. PCMS activated Nrf2 signaling and inhibited thioredoxin (Trx)-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression in LPS-treated mice. Collectively, present data suggest that PCMS, contrary to severe and uncontrolled stress, alleviated impairments of the Nrf2-TXNIP-Trx system and may contribute to inflammatory brain damage and the imbalance of cellular redox homeostasis in depressed mice. This study provides a mechanistic link to the resilience of PCMS to LPS-induced behavioral deficits.","Predictable chronic mild stress, Neuroinflammation, Depression, NLRP3",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0463-2,2019
SGIP1α functions as a selective endocytic adaptor for the internalization of synaptotagmin 1 at synapses,"Sang-Eun Lee1,, Soomin Jeong1,, Unghwi Lee1 &, Sunghoe Chang1",Sunghoe Chang,sunghoe@snu.ac.kr,2019-05-03,"Proper sorting of exocytosed synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins into individual SVs during endocytosis is of the utmost importance for the fidelity of subsequent neurotransmission. Recent studies suggest that each SV protein is sorted into individual SVs by its own dedicated adaptors as well as by association between SV proteins. The SH3-containing GRB2-like protein 3-interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), an ortholog of Fer/Cip4 homology domain-only (FCHo) proteins, contains a μ-homology domain (μHD) and binds AP-2 and Eps15, thus functioning as an endocytic regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Its longest isoform SGIP1α is predominantly expressed in the brain but the functional significance of SGIP1 in SV recycling remains unknown. Here, we found that SGIP1α, a brain-specific long isoform of SGIP1 binds synaptotagmin1 (Syt1) via its μHD and promotes the internalization of Syt1 on the neuronal surface. The small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown (KD) of SGIP1α caused selective impairment of Syt1 internalization at hippocampal synapses and it was fully rescued by coexpression of the shRNA-resistant form of SGIP1α in KD neurons. We further found that the μHD of SGIP1α is structurally similar to those of AP-2 and stonin2, and mutations at Trp771 and Lys781, which correspond to Syt1-recognition motifs of AP-2 and stonin2, to Ala bound less efficiently to Syt1 and failed to rescue the endocytic defect of Syt1 caused by KD. Our results indicate that SGIP1α is an endocytic adaptor dedicated to the retrieval of surface-stranded Syt1. Since endocytic sorting of Syt1 is also mediated by the overlapping activities of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A/B (SV2A/B) and stonin2, our results suggest that complementary fail-safe mechanism by these proteins ensures high fidelity of Syt1 retrieval.","SGIP1α, synaptotagmin 1, Synaptic vesicle, Clathrin-mediated endocytosis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0464-1,2019

During the first postnatal week, both Cdh9 and Cdh11 were expressed at high levels in segregated sub-populations of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and the expression of both genes was declined as development proceeded. Developmental expression of Cdh11 was largely confined to dorsal lobules (lobules VI/VII) of the vermis as well as the lateral hemisphere area equivalent to the Crus I and Crus II areas in human brains, areas known to mediate high order cognitive functions in adults. Moreover, in lobules VI/VII of the vermis, Cdh9 and Cdh11 were expressed in a complementary pattern with the Cdh11-expressing areas flanked by Cdh9-expressing areas. Interestingly, the high level of Cdh11 expression in the central domain of lobules VI/VII was correlated with a low level of expression of the Purkinje cell marker calbindin, coinciding with a delayed maturation of Purkinje cells in the same area.

In addition, mGluR5 KO mice show higher breakpoints in the touchscreen Progressive Ratio (PR) and altered decision making in the Effort-related Choice (ERC) tasks. Interestingly, this impairment in PR is an additional manifestation of an increased propensity to perseverate on the emission of relatively simplistic behavioural outputs.Together, these findings suggest that under conditions of low stress, mGluR5 KO mice exhibit a pronounced perseverative phenotype that blunts cognitive flexibility.","mGluR5, Behavioural flexibility, Perseveration, Reversal learning, Extinction, Progressive ratio schedule",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0441-8,2019

In the present study, we show that CTEP can correct aberrant phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling detected in zQ175 mice that may underlie the enhanced ULK1 activity and activation of autophagy. We also show that CTEP can facilitate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to foster neuronal survival and reduce apoptosis. Taken together, our findings provide the molecular evidence for how targeting mGluR5 using a well-tolerated selective NAM can mitigate two critical mechanisms of neurodegeneration, autophagy and apoptosis.","mGluR5, Huntington’s disease, zQ175, mHTT, CTEP, ULK1, mTOR, BDNF, autophagy",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0456-1,2019

In particular, neuronal autophagy is essential for cellular homeostasis and neuronal survival and is tightly regulated by several autophagy-related (ATG) proteins in post-mitotic neurons. Among these ATG proteins, the LC3/GABARAP proteins are known to regulate autophagosome biogenesis/maturation and cargo recognition. However, little is known about the role of GABARAP family proteins in neuronal autophagy despite their abundant expression in post-mitotic neurons. We have previously developed HyD (Hydrophobic Domain)-LIR (LC3-interacting region)-based autophagosome markers. In this study, to monitor GABARAP family proteins in autophagosomes of post-mitotic neurons, we improved the sensitivity of the probes for specifically detecting endogenous GABARAP family proteins by adding one more LIR motif to the LIR probes. We have tested the efficiency of two different LIRs, from ULK2 and Stbd1, in regard to their cellular localization to autophagosomes. HyD-2xLIR(ULK2)-GFP and HyD-2xLIR(Stbd1)-GFP demonstrated specific localization to GABARAP-positive autophagosomes relative to LC3B-positive autophagosomes in MEF/HeLa cells in an autophagy-dependent manner. Indeed, HyD-2xLIR(Stbd1)-GFP could efficiently detect GABARAP-positive autophagosomes in cultured cortical neurons.

However, a more recent study using skin touch domes has raised the possibility that Merkel discs are adrenergic synapses. It was proposed that norepinephrine is released from Merkel cells upon mechanical stimulation to subsequently activate β2 adrenergic receptors on Merkel disc nerve endings leading to nerve impulses. In the present study, we examined effects of norepinephrine and β2 adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 on Merkel disc mechanoreceptors in mouse whisker hair follicles.

In interleaved experiments, STP and LTP were induced by three episodes of either compressed or spaced TBS (cTBS or sTBS). LFS had a more pronounced effect on the LTP induced by the cTBS. One traditional interpretation of these results is a difference in the time-dependent immunity against depotentiation. We suggest an alternative explanation: LFS rapidly reverses STP to reveal a slowly developing LTP. The cTBS protocol induces LTP1 that is moderately sensitive to depotentiation.

Intriguingly, chronic in utero fluoxetine treatment impaired working memory and social novelty recognition in adult males. In the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key region regulating these behaviors, we found augmented spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Fast-spiking interneurons in mPFC exhibited enhanced intrinsic excitability and serotonin-induced excitability due to upregulated serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) signaling.

We found that the occurrence of fear significantly interfered with anxiety measurements under various conditions. Diazepam reduced basal anxiety level but had no effect during the presentation of conditioned stimulus (CS). Injection of an inhibitory peptide of PKMzeta (ZIP) into the basolateral amygdala almost entirely abolished CS-triggered fear expression and reduced anxiety to basal level.

Direct comparisons with sAPPβ, produced in the Aβ-generating pathway, are missing in order to determine the role of sAPPα’s carbonyl-terminal end in its possible neuroprotective activity.MethodsMouse neuronal primary cultures and hippocampal slices were treated with oligomeric Aβ42. The effects on tau phosphorylation and dendritic spine densities were assessed by western blot and confocal imaging, respectively. Co-administration of either sAPPα or sAPPβ was used to determine activity on Aβ-induced toxicity.Results/discussionWe found that oligomeric Aβ strongly increased AT8 and AT180 phosphorylation of tau and caused a loss of dendritic spines. SAPPα completely abolished Aβ effects whereas sAPPβ had no such rescue activity. Interestingly, sAPPα or sAPPβ alone neither affected tau phosphorylation nor dendritic spine numbers. Together, our data suggest that sAPPα specifically protects neurons against Aβ-dependent toxicity supporting the strategy of activating α-secretase-dependent endoproteolytic APP processing to increase sAPPα shedding from the neuronal plasma membrane as a therapeutic intervention for the protection of dendritic spines and phospho-tau-dependent toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease.","sAPPα, sAPPβ, Aβ, Tau, Dendritic spines, Alzheimer’s disease",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0447-2,2019

The stressed mice acquired anxiety-like behavior after 2 weeks and exaggerated startle response after 4 weeks. Avoidance latency and freezing behavior were sustained up to 5 weeks post stress and abnormal static behavior was observed during the sleep period. RNA sequencing was performed in two of the emotional regulatory regions, anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, at 2 and 5 weeks post stress. More than 1000 differentially expressed genes were identified at 2 weeks in both regions. The number of the regulated genes remained constant in amygdala at 5 weeks post stress, whereas those in anterior cingulate cortex were plummeted. Although synaptic remodeling and endocrine system were the most enriched signaling pathways in both anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, the individual gene expression profile was regulated in a region- and time-dependent manner. In addition, several genes associated with PTSD involved in Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis were differentially regulated. These findings suggested that global gene expression profile was dynamically regulated in accordance with the disease development stage, and therefore targeting the distinct signaling molecules in different region and development stage might be critical for effective treatment to PTSD.","Synaptic remodeling, Neuroendocrine, Long-term regulation, Anxiety, Avoidance, Hyperarousal, Sleep, RNA-seq, Amygdala, Anterior cingulate cortex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0449-0,2019

In line to hypomyelination, our data revealed downregulation of myelin structural and indispensable proteins in Npc1 mutant mice. Notably, the reduced ceramide synthase 2 (Cers2), UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (Ugt8), and glycolipid transfer protein (Gltp) indicate the altered sphingolipid metabolism in the disease and the involvement of Gltp in myelination. The identification of most reported myelin structural proteins and proteins from other cell types advocates the use of the corpus callosum to investigate proteins in different cell types that regulate myelination.","Proteomics, Corpus callosum, Npc1, Myelination, Lipid transport, Gltp",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0440-9,2019

Understanding the cross-talk between them could reveal potentials for the development of new strategies for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention thus improving the quality of life of those affected. Here we have conducted a novel meta-analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PD microarray datasets comprising 69 PD and 57 control brain samples which is the biggest cohort for such studies to date. Using identified DEGs, we performed pathway, upstream and protein-protein interaction analysis. We identified 1046 DEGs, of which a majority (739/1046) were downregulated in PD. YWHAZ and other genes coding 14–3-3 proteins are identified as important DEGs in signaling pathways and in protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN). Perturbed pathways also include mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. There was a significant overlap in DEGs between PD and AD, and over 99% of these were differentially expressed in the same up or down direction across the diseases. REST was identified as an upstream regulator in both diseases. Our study demonstrates that PD and AD share significant common DEGs and pathways, and identifies novel genes, pathways and upstream regulators which may be important targets for therapy in both diseases.","Systems analysis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Meta-analysis, Gene expression, Transcriptome analysis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0436-5,2019

The ability of spinophilin to alter synaptic strength appears to involve its scaffolding of key synaptic proteins, including the important structural element F-actin, AMPA/NMDA modulator protein phosphatase 1, and neuromodulatory G-protein coupled receptors, including dopamine receptor D2 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. Additionally, spinophilin is highly expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is fundamentally involved in reward-processing and locomotor activity which receives both glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of spinophilin in behavioral responses to cocaine, evaluating wild-type and spinophilin knockout mice followed by the examination of underlying molecular alterations. Although acute locomotor response was not affected, deletion of spinophilin blocked the development and expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine while maintaining normal conditioned place preference. This behavioral alteration in spinophilin knockout mice was accompanied by attenuated c-Fos and ∆FosB expression following cocaine administration and blunted cocaine-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the striatum, with no change in other relevant signaling molecules. Therefore, we suggest spinophilin fulfills an essential role in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, likely via ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induction of c-Fos and ∆FosB in the striatum, a mechanism that may underlie specific processes in cocaine addiction.","Drug addiction, Spinophilin, Cocaine, Behavioral sensitization",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0434-7,2019

However, it is not clear whether DA-JC1 improves the Aβ31–35-induced decline in learning and memory ability by restoring disrupted circadian rhythms. In the present study, we carried out a mouse wheel-running experiment and Morris water maze test (MWM) and found that DA-JC1 could effectively improve the decline of learning and memory and circadian rhythm disorders induced by Aβ31–35. After downregulating Per2 expression via lentivirus-shPer2 in the hippocampus and the hippocampal HT22 cells, we found that circadian rhythm disorders occurred, and that DA-JC1 could not improve the impaired learning and memory.

The major targets of the cerebellar projections are the thalamic regions including the ventroanterior nucleus (VA) and ventrolateral nucleus (VL). Another thalamic target is the central lateral nucleus (CL), which receives the innervations mainly from the dentate nucleus (DN) in the cerebellum. Although previous electrophysiological studies suggest the role of the CL as the relay of cerebellar functions, the kinds of behavioral functions mediated by cerebellothalamic tracts projecting to the CL remain unknown. Here, we used immunotoxin (IT) targeting technology combined with a neuron-specific retrograde labeling technique, and selectively eliminated the cerebellothalamic tracts of mice. We confirmed that the number of neurons in the DN was selectively decreased by the IT treatment. These IT-treated mice showed normal overground locomotion with no ataxic behavior. However, elimination of these neurons impaired motor coordination in the rotarod test and forelimb movement in the reaching test. These mice showed intact acquisition and flexible change of spatial information processing in the place discrimination, Morris water maze, and T-maze tests. Although the tract labeling indicated the existence of axonal collaterals of the DN-CL pathway to the rostral part of the VA/VL complex, excitatory lesion of the rostral VA/VL did not show any significant alterations in motor coordination or forelimb reaching, suggesting no requirement of axonal branches connecting to the VL/VA complex for motor skill function. Taken together, our data highlight that the cerebellothalamic tracts projecting to the CL play a key role in the control of motor skills, including motor coordination and forelimb reaching, but not spatial recognition and its flexibility.","Cerebellum, Dentate nucleus, Thalamus, Central lateral nucleus, Motor skill, Spatial recognition",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0431-x,2019

Mutation of a cluster of lysines present in the intracellular N-terminus region of β-ENaC (K4R/ K5R/ K9R/ K16R/ K23R) reduced interactions with Cav3.2 calcium channels. Αβγ-ENaC channels enhanced Cav3.2 calcium channel trafficking to the plasma membrane in tsA-201 cells.

We investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of baicalin in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of ADHD depending on the dopamine (DA) deficit theory. In this study, fifty SHRs were randomly divided into five groups: methylphenidate (MPH), baicalin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 150 mg/kg), and saline-treated. Ten Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. All rats were orally administered the treatment for four weeks. Motor activity, spatial learning and memory ability were assessed with the open-field and Morris water-maze tests. The mRNA and protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), synaptosomal-associated protein of molecular mass 25kD (SNAP25) and synataxin 1a in synaptosomes were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. In addition, DA levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The results indicated that both MPH and baicalin at doses of 150 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly decreased the hyperactivity and improved the spatial learning memory deficit in the SHRs and increased the synaptosomal mRNA and protein levels of TH, SNAP25, VMAT2 and synataxin 1a compared with saline treatment. MPH significantly increased DA levels in both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum, while baicalin significantly increased DA levels only in the striatum. The results of the present study showed that baicalin treatment was effective for controlling the core symptoms of ADHD. Baicalin increased DA levels only in the striatum, which suggested that baicalin may target the striatum. The increased DA levels may partially be attributed to the increased mRNA and protein expression of TH, SNAP25, VMAT2, and syntaxin 1a. Therefore, these results suggested that the pharmacological effects of baicalin were associated with the synthesis, vesicular localization, and release of DA and might be effective in treating ADHD. However, further studies are required to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these findings.","Baicalin, ADHD, Dopamine, Spontaneously hypertensive rats, Behavioral tests",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0428-5,2019

Therefore, we sought to determine whether chronic morphine induced similar changes in the morphology of VTA DA neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We utilized Cre-dependent retrograde viral vectors in DA Cre driver lines to label VTA DA neurons that projected to NAc and PFC and assessed neuronal soma size. Consistent with previous data, the soma size of VTA DA neurons that projected to the NAc medial shell was decreased following morphine exposure. However, soma size of VTA DA neurons that projected to the NAc core was unaltered by morphine. Interestingly, morphology of PFC-projecting VTA DA neurons was also altered by morphine, but in this case soma size was increased compared to sham controls. Differences in basal soma size were also noted, suggesting stable differences in projection-specific morphology in addition to drug-induced changes. Together, these data suggest morphine-induced changes in VTA DA morphology occur within distinct VTA DA populations and that study of opiate-induced structural plasticity of individual VTA DA subcircuits may be critical for understanding addiction-related behavior.","Dopamine, Morphine, Morphology, Opiate, Ventral tegmental area",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0435-6,2019

Genetic risk variants for brain disorders are enriched in cortical H3K27ac domains,"Eilis Hannon1,, Sarah J. Marzi2,, Leonard S. Schalkwyk3 &, Jonathan Mill1",Jonathan Mill,J.Mill@exeter.ac.uk,2019-01-28,"Most variants associated with complex phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) do not directly index coding changes affecting protein structure. Instead they are hypothesized to influence gene regulation, with common variants associated with disease being enriched in regulatory domains including enhancers and regions of open chromatin. There is interest, therefore, in using epigenomic annotation data to identify the specific regulatory mechanisms involved and prioritize risk variants. We quantified lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) - a robust mark of active enhancers and promoters that is strongly correlated with gene expression and transcription factor binding – across the genome in entorhinal cortex samples using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). H3K27ac peaks were called using high quality reads combined across all samples and formed the basis of partitioned heritability analysis using LD score regression along with publicly-available GWAS results for seven psychiatric and neurodegenerative traits. Heritability for all seven brain traits was significantly enriched in these H3K27ac peaks (enrichment ranging from 1.09–2.13) compared to regions of the genome containing other active regulatory and functional elements across multiple cell types and tissues. The strongest enrichments were for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (enrichment = 2.19; 95% CI = 2.12–2.27), autism (enrichment = 2.11; 95% CI = 2.05–2.16) and major depressive disorder (enrichment = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.92–2.16). Much lower enrichments were observed for 14 non-brain disorders, although we identified enrichment in cortical H3K27ac domains for body mass index (enrichment = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.13–1.19), ever smoked (enrichment = 2.07; 95% CI = 2.04–2.10), HDL (enrichment = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.45–1.62) and trigylcerides (enrichment = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.24–1.42). These results indicate that risk alleles for brain disorders are preferentially located in regions of regulatory/enhancer function in the cortex, further supporting the hypothesis that genetic variants for these phenotypes influence gene regulation in the brain.","H3K27ac, Active enhancer, Promoter, GWAS, Brain disorder, LD score regression, Psychiatric illness, Neurodegenerative disease, Epigenetics",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0429-4,2019

These neurological symptoms result from synaptic dysregulations, which shift a balance between excitation and inhibition. To decipher the synaptic substrate of hyperexcitability, we examined pan-neuronal Tsc1 knockout mouse and found a reduction in surface expression of a GABA receptor (GABAR) subunit but not AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit. Using electrophysiological recordings, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of GABAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABAR-mIPSCs) but not AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPAR-mEPSCs) in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. To determine a subpopulation of interneurons that are especially vulnerable to the absence of TSC1 function, we also analyzed two strains of conditional knockout mice targeting two of the prominent interneuron subtypes that express parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST). Unlike pan-neuronal knockout mice, both interneuron-specific Tsc-1 knockout mice did not develop spontaneous seizures and grew into adults. Further, the properties of AMPAR-mEPSCs and GABAR-mIPSCs were normal in both Pv-Cre and Sst-Cre x Tsc1fl/fl knockout mice. These results indicate that removal of TSC1 from all neurons in a local cortical circuit results in hyperexcitability while connections between pyramidal neurons and interneurons expressing PV and SST are preserved in the layer 2/3 visual cortex. Our study suggests that another inhibitory cell type or a combination of multiple subtypes may be accountable for hyperexcitability in TSC.","Tuberous sclerosis complex, E/I balance, AMPA receptor, GABA receptor, Autism, Epilepsy, mTOR pathway",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0427-6,2019

Quantitative analyses showed no significant differences, but slight decreases, in the potency of differentiation into GABAergic neurons derived from iPSCs between healthy control and patients with PARK2 mutations, who have been classified as a type of early-onset familial PD due to mutations in the parkin gene. Under this condition, the mRNA level of SST in GABAergic interneurons derived from iPSCs of PARK2-specific PD patients significantly decreased as neural maturation progressed. We also found that SST-positive GABAergic neurons were clearly reduced in GABAergic neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with PARK2 mutations.

Atrophic changes were widely observed in the injured spinal cord both rostral and caudal to the lesion, but the decrease in area was mainly in the white matter in the rostral spinal cord while both the white and gray matter decreased in the caudal spinal cord.

The overactivation of mTOR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).

Rodent pups that are exposed to VPA in utero have been used as an animal model of ASD. Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway was recently observed in rodents that were exposed to VPA in utero, and rapamycin ameliorated social interaction deficits. The present study investigated the effect of rapamycin on social interaction deficits in both adolescence and adulthood, and gene expressions in mice that were exposed to VPA in utero.

The pups were intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin or an equal volume of vehicle once daily for 2 consecutive days. The social interaction test was conducted in the offspring after the last rapamycin administration at 5–6 weeks of ages (adolescence) or 10–11 weeks of age (adulthood). Whole brains were collected after the social interaction test in the adulthood, and microarray and Western blot analyses were performed. Mice that were exposed to VPA and treated with vehicle exhibited a decrease in social interaction compared with control mice that were treated with vehicle. Rapamycin treatment in VPA-exposed mice improved social deficits. Mice that were exposed to VPA and treated with vehicle exhibited the aberrant expression of genes in the mTOR signaling pathway, and rapamycin treatment recovered changes in the expression of some genes, including Fyb and A330094K24Rik.

However, gain-of-function study manipulating CA3 cell ensembles has not been reported. The CA3 area of the hippocampus comprises a recurrent excitatory circuit, which is thought to be important for the generation of associations among the stored information within one brain region. We investigated whether the coincident firing of cell ensembles in one brain region, hippocampal CA3, associates distinct events. CA3 cell ensembles responding to context exploration and during contextual fear conditioning were labeled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry. The synchronous activation of these ensembles induced freezing behavior in mice in a neutral context, in which a foot shock had never been delivered. The recall of this artificial associative fear memory was context specific. In vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that 20-Hz optical stimulation of ChR2-mCherry-expressing CA3 neurons, which is the same stimulation protocol used in behavioral experiment, induced long-term potentiation at CA3-CA3 synapses. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the synchronous activation of ensembles in one brain region, CA3 of the hippocampus, is sufficient for the association of distinct events. The results of our electrophysiology potentially suggest that this artificial association of memory events might be induced by the strengthening of synaptic efficacy between CA3 ensembles via recurrent circuit.","Hippocampus, CA3, Recurrent circuit, Artificial association, Synaptic plasticity, Long-term potentiation (LTP), Optogenetics",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0424-1,2019

In this study, we identify the peacefulness (pfs) gene as a novel player in the control of male-male aggression in Drosophila. Mutations in pfs decreased intermale aggressiveness, but did not affect locomotor activity, olfactory avoidance response and sexual behaviours. pfs encodes for the evolutionarily conserved molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis 1 protein (Mocs1), which catalyzes the first step in the MoCo biosynthesis pathway. Neuronal-specific knockdown of pfs decreased aggressiveness. By contrast, overexpression of pfs greatly increased aggressiveness. Knocking down Cinnamon (Cin) catalyzing the final step in the MoCo synthesis pathway, caused a pfs-like aggression phenotype. In humans, inhibition of MoCo-dependent enzymes displays anti-aggressive effects. Thus, the control of aggression by Pfs-dependent MoCo pathways may be conserved throughout evolution.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0417-0,2019
What does LTP tell us about the roles of CaMKII and PKMζ in memory?,"Todd Charlton Sacktor1,2 &, André Antonio Fenton1,3,4","Todd Charlton Sacktor, André Antonio Fenton","tsacktor@downstate.edu, afenton@nyu.edu",2018-12-28,"In “Criteria for identifying the molecular basis of the engram (CaMKII, PKMζ),” Lisman proposes that elucidating the mechanism of LTP maintenance is key to understanding memory storage. He suggests three criteria for a maintenance mechanism to evaluate data on CaMKII and PKMζ as memory storage molecules: necessity, occlusion, and erasure. Here we show that when the criteria are tested, the results reveal important differences between the molecules. Inhibiting PKMζ reverses established, protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP, without affecting early-LTP or baseline synaptic transmission. In contrast, blocking CaMKII has two effects: 1) inhibiting CaMKII activity blocks LTP induction but not maintenance, and 2) disrupting CaMKII interactions with NMDARs in the postsynaptic density (PSD) depresses both early-LTP and basal synaptic transmission equivalently. To identify a maintenance mechanism, we propose a fourth criterion — persistence. PKMζ increases for hours during LTP maintenance in hippocampal slices, and for over a month in specific brain regions during long-term memory storage in conditioned animals. In contrast, increased CaMKII activity lasts only minutes following LTP induction, and CaMKII translocation to the PSD in late-LTP or memory has not been reported. Lastly, do the PKMζ and CaMKII models integrate the many other signaling molecules important for LTP? Activity-dependent PKMζ synthesis is regulated by many of the signaling molecules that induce LTP, including CaMKII, providing a plausible mechanism for new gene expression in the persistent phosphorylation by PKMζ maintaining late-LTP and memory. In contrast, CaMKII autophosphorylation and translocation do not appear to require new protein synthesis. Therefore, the cumulative evidence supports a core role for PKMζ in late-LTP and long-term memory maintenance, and separate roles for CaMKII in LTP induction and for the maintenance of postsynaptic structure and synaptic transmission in a mechanism distinct from late-LTP.",,https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0420-5,2018

EriB targeted inhibition of microglia activity attenuates MPP+ induced DA neuron injury through the NF-κB signaling pathway,"Fangfang Dou1 na1,, Xinkun Chu1 na1,, Bei Zhang1,, Liang Liang1,, Guoqiang Lu1,, Jianqing Ding1 &, Shengdi Chen1","Jianqing Ding, Shengdi Chen","jqding18@yahoo.com, chensd@rjh.com.cn",2018-12-18,"Accumulating evidence indicates that microglia activation is associated with an increased risk for developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). With the progressive and selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD patients. Thus, anti-inflammation has become one of the therapeutic strategies of PD. Eriocalyxin B (EriB), a diterpenoid isolated from Isodoneriocalyx, was previously reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. MPTP mouse model and MPP+ cell model were prepared to detect the role of EriB in regulating microglia activation and neuron protection. Midbrain tissue and primary cultured microglia and neuron were used to examine microglia activation and neuron damage by immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, western-blot and Elisa assay. Open field activity test was to evaluate the changes of behavioral activity in MPTP-induced PD mouse model. EriB was efficacious in protecting DA neurons by inhibiting microglia activation in PD mice model. Treatment with EriB led to amelioration of disordered sports of PD mice model, which correlated with reduced microglia-associated inflammation and damaged DA neurons. EriB treatment abolished MPP+ induced microglia activation damages to DA neurons in a microglia and DA neurons co-culture system. The underlying mechanism of EriB-induced protective effects involved inhibition of microglia associated proinflammatory cytokines production through the phenotypic shift of microglial cells as well as activator of transcription and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. These findings demonstrate that EriB exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects through selective modulation of microglia activation by targeting NF-κB signaling pathways, thus exerting the protective effect against on MPP+-induced DA neurons injury.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of high-fat diet on the brain metabolism by a multimodal imaging method using the hyperpolarizedcarbon 13 (13C)-pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging in conjunction with the biochemical assay and the behavior test in a mouse model fed high-fat diet (HFD). In mice were fed 60% HFD for 6 months, hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate MR spectroscopy showed decreased perfusion (p < 0.01) and increased conversion from pyruvate to lactate (p < 0.001) in the brain. The hippocampus and striatum showed the highest conversion ratio. The functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier tested by dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging showed no difference to the control. Lactate was increased in the cortex (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.05), while PDH activity was decreased in the cortex (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.001) and the phosphorylated PDH was increased in the striatum (p < 0.05).

These results suggest that the increased hyperpolarized [1-13C] lactate signal in the brain of HFD-fed mice represent that altered metabolic alteration toward to glycolysis and hypoperfusion by the long-term metabolic stress by HFD further promote to glycolysis.

However, although some reports have shown loss and gain of body weight in Shank3 knock-out and overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice, respectively, the potential functions of Shank3 in the hypothalamus, a brain region critically involved in energy intake and expenditure, are unknown. Hence, we first characterized endogenous Shank3 mRNA and protein expression in the hypothalamus of adult wild-type mice. Thereafter, we performed transcriptome analysis (RNA-sequencing) in the hypothalamus of adult Shank3 TG mice which mildly overexpress Shank3 proteins. By comparing the 174 differentially expressed genes in the hypothalamus with those previously reported in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Shank3 TG mice, we found that 159 were hypothalamus-specific while only 15 were also observed in either the striatum or mPFC. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis of the RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that ribosome-related genes were enriched especially in the up-regulated genes of Shank3 TG hypothalamus, which is in contrast to the results of the Shank3 TG striatum and mPFC analyses, where ribosome-related genes were enriched in the down-regulated genes.

Chondroitinase ABC was administrated intravitreally 1 week after ocular hypertension (a time point where dendritic atrophy has already occurred). Retinal ganglion cell dendritic morphology was unaffected by chondroitinase ABC in normal retina. In ocular hypertensive eyes retinal ganglion cells showed significantly decreased dendritic length and area under the Sholl curve with atrophy confined to higher order dendrites. These changes were not observed in chondroitinase ABC injected eyes despite similar total retinal ganglion cell loss (i.e. dendritic protection of surviving retinal ganglion cells).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neutrotrophic factor essential for the survival and differentiation of neurons and is considered a key target in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases, as for example AD. Contrarily to BDNF, the precursor form of BDNF (proBDNF) induces apoptosis through the specific interaction with p75 and its co-receptor, Sortilin.We used hippocampal tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients and controls. to study the localization and the levels of proBDNF, p75 and Sortilin as well as the post-traduccional modifications of proBDNF induced by Radical Oxygen Species, by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Differentiation and survival were assessed on differentiated mouse hippocampal neurons derived from postnatal neural stem cells from WT animals or from the transgenic AD animal model APP/PS1∆E9, based on mutations of familiar AD. In AD patients we observe a significative increase of proBDNF and Sortilin expression and a significative increase of the ratio proBDNF/BDNF in their cerebrospinal fluid compared to controls. In addition, the proBDNF of AD patients is modified by ROS-derived advanced glycation end products, which prevent the processing of the proBDNF to the mature BDNF, leading to an increase of pathogenicity and a decrease of trophic effects. The cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients, but not from controls, induces apoptosis in differentiated hippocampal neurons mainly by the action of AGE-modified proBDNF present in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients. This effect is triggered by the activation and processing of p75 that stimulate the internalization of the intracellular domain (ICD) within the nucleus causing apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis and p75 ICD internalization by AD patients-derived proBDNF is further enhanced in neuron cultures from the AD model expressing the APP/PS1∆E9 transgene.Our results indicate the importance of proBDNF neurotoxic signaling in AD pathology essentially by three mechanisms: i) by an increase of proBDNF stability due to ROS-induced post-traductional modifications; ii) by the increase of expression of the p75 co-receptor, Sortilin and iii) by the increase of the basal levels of p75 processing found in AD.","Alzheimer’s disease, Biomarkers, BDNF, p75, proBDNF, Oxidative stress, Sortilin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0411-6,2018

The ability of single neurons to transform their input into output action potential is primarily determined by intrinsic excitability. Particularly, plastic changes in intrinsic excitability represent the cellular substrate for spatial memory formation in CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1-PNs). Here, we report that synaptically activated mGluR5-signaling can modulate the intrinsic excitability of CA1-PNs. Specifically, high-frequency stimulation at CA3-CA1 synapses increased firing rate and advanced spike onset with an improvement of temporal precision. These changes are mediated by mGluR5 activation that induces cADPR/RyR-dependent Ca2+ release in the dendrites of CA1-PNs, which in turn causes an increase in persistent Na+ currents (INa,P) in the dendrites. When group I mGluRs in CA1-PNs are globally activated pharmacologically, afterdepolarization (ADP) generation as well as increased firing rate are observed. These effects are abolished by inhibiting mGluR5/cADPR/RyR-dependent Ca2+ release. However, the increase in firing rate, but not the generation of ADP is affected by inhibiting INa,P. The differences between local and global activation of mGluR5-signaling in CA1-PNs indicates that mGluR5-dependent modulation of intrinsic excitability is highly compartmentalized and a variety of ion channels are recruited upon their differential subcellular localizations. As mGluR5 activation is induced by physiologically plausible brief high-frequency stimulation at CA3-CA1 synapses, our results suggest that mGluR5-induced enhancement of dendritic INa,P in CA1-PNs may provide important implications for our understanding about place field formation in the hippocampus.","mGluR5-dependent plasticity, Persistent sodium current, CA1 pyramidal neurons, Intrinsic excitability",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0410-7,2018

The mainstay treatment for ADHD is stimulant medications (e.g. methylphenidate), which increase synaptic dopamine by directly blocking dopamine transporter (DAT). Although these pharmacological agents are effective, they are often associated with various side effects including risks for future substance use disorders in ADHD patients. Here, we investigated an interaction between DAT and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) as a novel target to develop potential therapeutics for the treatment of ADHD by using an interfering peptide (TAT-DATNT) to dissociate this protein complex. We found that TAT-DATNT promotes locomotor behavior in Sprague-Dawley rats.

Primary TBI from blast exposure is commonly characterized by internal injuries, such as vascular damage, neuronal injury, and contusion, without external injuries. Current animal models of blast-induced TBI (bTBI) have helped to understand the deleterious effects of moderate to severe blast forces. However, the neurological effects of mild blast forces remain poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the effects caused by mild blast forces combining neuropathological, histological, biochemical and neurophysiological analysis. For this purpose, we employed a rodent blast TBI model with blast forces below the level that causes macroscopic neuropathological changes. We found that mild blast forces induced neuroinflammation in cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Moreover, mild blast triggered microvascular damage and axonal injury. Furthermore, mild blast caused deficits in hippocampal short-term plasticity and synaptic excitability, but no impairments in long-term potentiation. Finally, mild blast exposure induced proteolytic cleavage of spectrin and the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator, p35 in hippocampus. Together, these findings show that mild blast forces can cause aberrant neurological changes that critically impact neuronal functions. These results are consistent with the idea that mild blast forces may induce subclinical pathophysiological changes that may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders.","Blast-induced traumatic brain injury, Neuroinflammation, Microvascular damage, Axonal swelling, Short-term plasticity, Calpain, p25",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0408-1,2018

Induction of unilateral vision loss in adult mice, by monocular enucleation (ME), is a validated model for such cross-modal brain plasticity. A delayed whisker-driven take-over of the medial monocular zone of the visual cortex is preceded by so-called unimodal plasticity, involving the potentiation of the spared-eye inputs in the binocular cortical territory. Full reactivation of the sensory-deprived contralateral visual cortex is accomplished by 7 weeks post-injury. Serotonin (5-HT) is known to modulate sensory information processing and integration, but its impact on cortical reorganization after sensory loss, remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we assessed the involvement of 5-HT in ME-induced cross-modal plasticity and the 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) subtype used. We first focused on establishing the impact of ME on the total 5-HT concentration measured in the visual cortex and in the somatosensory barrel field. Next, the changes in expression as a function of post-ME recovery time of the monoamine transporter 2 (vMAT2), which loads 5-HT into presynaptic vesicles, and of the 5-HTR1A and 5-HTR3A were assessed, in order to link these temporal expression profiles to the different types of cortical plasticity induced by ME. In order to accurately pinpoint which 5-HTR exactly mediates ME-induced cross-modal plasticity, we pharmacologically antagonized the 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR2A and 5-HTR3A subtypes. This study reveals brain region-specific alterations in total 5-HT concentration, time-dependent modulations in vMAT2, 5-HTR1A and 5-HTR3A protein expression and 5-HTR antagonist-specific effects on the post-ME plasticity phenomena. Together, our results confirm a role for 5-HTR1A in the early phase of binocular visual cortex plasticity and suggest an involvement of 5-HTR2A and 5-HTR3A but not 5-HTR1A during the late cross-modal recruitment of the medial monocular visual cortex. These insights contribute to the general understanding of 5-HT function in cortical plasticity and may encourage the search for improved rehabilitation strategies to compensate for sensory loss.","Brain plasticity, Visual cortex, Adult mice, Monocular enucleation, Neuromodulator, Serotonin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0404-5,2018

Because Caskin1 forms homo-multimers and binds not only CASK but also other neuronal proteins in vitro, it is anticipated to have neural functions; but its exact role in mammals remains unclear. Previously, we showed that the concentration of Caskin1 in the spinal dorsal horn increases under chronic pain. To characterize this protein, we generated Caskin1-knockout (Caskin1-KO) mice and specific anti-Caskin1 antibodies. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that Caskin1 was broadly distributed in the whole brain and spinal cord, and that it primarily localized at synapses. To elucidate the neural function of Caskin1 in vivo, we subjected Caskin1-KO mice to comprehensive behavioral analysis. The mutant mice exhibited differences in gait, enhanced nociception, and anxiety-like behavior relative to their wild-type littermates. In addition, the knockouts exhibited strong freezing responses, with or without a cue tone, in contextual and cued-fear conditioning tests as well as low memory retention in the Barnes Maze test. Taken together, these results suggest that Caskin1 contributes to a wide spectrum of behavioral phenotypes, including gait, nociception, memory, and stress response, in broad regions of the central nervous system.","Caskin1, Behavioral test battery, Caskin1-KO mouse, Central nervous system, Nociception",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0407-2,2018

However, excessive activity of these receptors can be cytotoxic and thus their function must be precisely controlled. We have previously reported that NMDA receptor activity is dysregulated following genetic knockout of cellular prion protein (PrPC), and that PrPC regulation of NMDA receptors is copper-dependent. Here, we employed electrophysiological methods to study NMDAR and AMPAR currents of cultured hippocampal neurons from PrPC overexpresser mice. We show that NMDA receptor current amplitude and kinetics are differentially modulated by overexpression of human or mouse PrPC. By contrast, AMPA receptor activity was unaffected. Nonetheless, AMPA receptor activity was modulated by copper ions in a manner similar to what we previously reported for NMDA receptors. Taken together, our findings reveal that AMPA and NMDA receptors are differentially regulated by PrPC, but share common modulation by copper ions.","NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor, Cellular prion protein, Knock-in mice, Whole-cell patch clamp, Hippocampal neurons, CNS disorders, Copper",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0406-3,2018

Thus, the approach toward Aβ metabolism is considered to play a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Mounting evidence suggests that lifestyle-related diseases are closely associated with AD, and exercise is especially linked to the prevention and the delayed progression of AD. We previously showed that exercise is more effective than diet control against Aβ pathology and cognitive deficit in AD mice fed a high-fat diet; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. On the other hand, a report suggested that exercise induced expression of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) in the hippocampus of mice through PGC1α pathway. Thus, in the current study, we investigated a possibility that FNDC5 interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and affects Aβ metabolism. As a result, for the first time ever, we found the interaction between FNDC5 and APP, and forced expression of FNDC5 significantly decreased levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted in the media. Taken together, our results indicate that FNDC5 significantly affects β-cleavage of APP via the interaction with APP, finally regulating Aβ levels. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the interaction between APP and FNDC5 may affect Aβ production in an exercise-dependent manner would provide new preventive strategies against the development of AD.","Fibronectin Type III Domain-containing Protein 5 (FNDC5), Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Irisin, Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA), HEK293 Cells",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0401-8,2018

Long non-coding RNA H19 and MALAT1 gene variants in patients with ischemic stroke in a northern Chinese Han population,"Ruixia Zhu1,, Xu Liu1 &, Zhiyi He1",Zhiyi He,hezhiyi1982@163.com,2018-10-10,"Objectives Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as key regulators in the development of atherosclerosis, which is a major cause of ischemic stroke. However, to date, there are no reports on the association between lncRNA gene variation and the risk of ischemic stroke. Therefore, we assessed the association between H19 and MALAT1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to ischemic stroke in a northern Chinese Han population. Methods In our study, we genotyped four genetic variations in lncRNA-H19 and -MALAT1 (rs217727, rs2251375, rs619586, and rs3200401) in a case–control study of 567 ischemic stroke patients and 552 control subjects. Results We found that the TT genotype of the rs217727 polymorphism within H19 was significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in our northern Chinese Han population (odds ration (OR) = 1.519, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.072–2.152, p = 0.018). Stratified analysis based on stroke subtype revealed that the increased risk was more evident in small vessel ischemic stroke (OR = 1.941, 95% CI = 1.260–2.992, p = 0.02). Individuals with the TT genotype had a 1.941 times higher risk of small vessel ischemic stroke when compared with the subjects of CC + CT. These correlations remained after adjusting for confounding risk factors of stroke (OR = 1.913, 95% CI = 1.221–2.998, p = 0.005). However, there was no significant association between H19 rs2251375 or MALAT1 rs3200401 and ischemic stroke in either total population analysis or subgroup analysis. Conclusion In conclusion, our findings suggest that the H19 rs217727 gene polymorphism contributes to small vessel ischemic stroke susceptibility in the Chinese Han population and may serve as a potential indicator for ischemic stroke susceptibility.","Ischemic stroke, Gene variants, H19, MALAT1",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0402-7,2018

SHANK3 duplications have been identified in patients with hyperkinetic disorders and early-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Consistently, Shank3 transgenic (TG) mice, which mildly overexpress Shank3 proteins exhibit hyperkinetic behavior and spontaneous seizures. However, the seizure phenotype of Shank3 TG mice has only been investigated in adults of the seizure-sensitive strain FVB/N. Therefore, it remains unknown if spontaneous seizures occur in Shank3 TG mice from the early postnatal stages onward, or even in seizure-resistant strains. Clinically, generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the critical risk factor for epilepsy-associated mortality. However, the potential association between Shank3 overexpression and mortality, at least in mice, has not been investigated in detail. In the present study, we backcrossed Shank3 TG mice in seizure-resistant C57BL/6 J strain and monitored their home-cage activities at 3 weeks of age. Of the 15 Shank3 TG mice monitored, two exhibited spontaneous tonic-clonic seizures, and one died immediately after the seizure event. Based on this observation, we determined the survival rate of the Shank3 TG mice from 3 to 12 weeks of age. We found that approximately 40–45% of the Shank3 TG mice, both males and females, died before reaching 12 weeks of age. Notably, 53% and 70% of the total deaths in male and female Shank3 TG mice, respectively, occurred in the juvenile stages. These results suggest spontaneous seizure and partial lethality of juvenile Shank3 TG mice in seizure-resistant background, further supporting the validity of this model.","Shank3 overexpression, Spontaneous seizure, Lethality, Juvenile stage",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0403-6,2018

We have identified several mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders with robust molecular and functional defects in the dentate gyrus. Among them, mice lacking Schnurri-2 (Shn2 or HIVEP2) have been proposed as a model of schizophrenia and intellectual disability. Shn2 knockout mice exhibit behavioral abnormalities resembling symptoms of schizophrenia and HIVEP2-related intellectual disability as well as marked functional alterations in the soma and output synapse of the dentate granule cells (GCs). Although robust abnormalities were also observed in the dendritic spine morphology in the GCs, their functional correlates remain unknown. In the present study, we performed electrophysiological analyses of synaptic transmission at the medial perforant path (MPP) input onto the GCs in Shn2 knockout mice. While the basal synaptic efficacy was preserved, short-term synaptic depression induced by paired-pulse or low-frequency stimulation was reduced in the mutant mice. High-frequency tetanic stimulation induced lasting synaptic potentiation in both wild-type and mutant mice. However, the decaying synaptic potentiation shortly after the tetanic stimulation was significantly reduced in the mutant mice. These results indicate that the Shn2 deficiency attenuates bidirectional short-term synaptic plasticity at the MPP-GC synapse, thereby rendering the synapse more static. Our finding further supports a possible role of the dentate gyrus dysfunction in pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may also provide important information in interpreting morphology changes of the brain synapses in neuropsychiatric disorders.","Short-term plasticity, Perforant path, Dentate gyrus, Schizophrenia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0400-9,2018

Using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI), we observed sustained activation in the bilateral insular cortices (ICs), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and cingulate cortex. Second, this study sought to link this sustained activation pattern with brain sensitization. Using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI), we observed enhanced activity in the ipsilateral anterior IC (AIC) in free-moving SNI rats on Days 1 and 8 post-SNI. Furthermore, enhanced functional connectivity between the ipsilateral AIC, bilateral rostral AIC, and S1 was observed on Day 8 post-SNI. Chronic electrophysiological recording experiments were conducted to confirm the tonic neuronal activation in selected brain regions.

In this study, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the insular cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. We found that KARs mediated currents were reduced in Fmr1 KO mice. KARs were mainly located in the synaptosomal fraction of the insular cortex. The abundance of KAR subunit GluK1 and GluK2/3 in the synaptosome was reduced in Fmr1 KO mice, whereas the total expressions of these KARs subunits were not changed. Finally, lack of FMRP impairs subsequent internalization of surface GluK2 after KAR activation, while having no effect on the surface GluK2 expression. Our studies provide evidence indicating that loss of FMRP leads to the abnormal function and localization of KARs.

In the present study, the effect of Nlgn2 knockout (Nlgn2−/−) on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in mice has been investigated. The EEG and electromyogram (EMG) were recorded in Nlgn2−/− mice and littermates for 24 h from which three vigilance states (i.e., wakefulness, rapid eye movement [REM] sleep, non-REM [NREM] sleep) were visually identified. Spectral analysis of the EEG was performed for the three states. Nlgn2−/− mice showed more wakefulness and less NREM and REM sleep compared to wild-type (Nlgn2+/+) mice, especially during the dark period. This was accompanied by changes in the number and duration of individual episodes of wakefulness and sleep, indexing changes in state consolidation, as well as widespread changes in EEG spectral activity in all states. Abnormal ‘hypersynchronized’ EEG events have also been observed predominantly in Nlgn2−/− mice. These events were mainly observed during wakefulness and REM sleep. In addition, Nlgn2−/− mice showed alterations in the daily time course of NREM sleep delta (1–4 Hz) activity, pointing to modifications in the dynamics of sleep homeostasis.

CBD does not bind directly to endocannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and despite research efforts, its specific targets remain to be fully identified. Notably, sigma 1 receptor (σ1R) antagonists inhibit glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate acid receptor (NMDAR) activity and display positive effects on most of the aforesaid diseases. Thus, we investigated the effects of CBD on three animal models in which NMDAR overactivity plays a critical role: opioid analgesia attenuation, NMDA-induced convulsive syndrome and ischemic stroke. In an in vitro assay, CBD disrupted the regulatory association of σ1R with the NR1 subunit of NMDAR, an effect shared by σ1R antagonists, such as BD1063 and progesterone, and prevented by σ1R agonists, such as 4-IBP, PPCC and PRE084. The in vivo administration of CBD or BD1063 enhanced morphine-evoked supraspinal antinociception, alleviated NMDA-induced convulsive syndrome, and reduced the infarct size caused by permanent unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion.

However, the role of SIRT6 in excitatory brain neurons in cognitive behaviors is not well characterized. We investigated how cognitive behaviors are affected by genetic SIRT6 depletion in excitatory neurons in the mouse forebrain. We generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line by mating two transgenic lines, Floxed SIRT6 and CaMKIIa-Cre. SIRT6 was thus deleted by Cre recombinase in CaMKIIa-expressing excitatory neurons. We performed cognitive behavioral tests, focusing on learning and memory, including contextual fear conditioning and Morris-water maze. The freezing level of SIRT6 cKO before the fear conditioning was comparable to that of wild-type littermate controls, while the freezing level after the conditioning was higher in SIRT6 cKO mice. In contrast, the mice showed normal spatial learning and memory in the Morris-water maze. In addition, anxiety and locomotion were also normal in SIRT6 cKO mice. SIRT6 genetic depletion enhanced contextual fear memory without affecting spatial memory. Since a previous report showed that overexpression of SIRT6 reduced contextual fear memory, our results suggest that the expression level of SIRT6 bi-directionally regulates contextual fear memory in mice.","Sirtuin, SIRT6, Behavior, Learning, Spatial memory, Contextual fear memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0391-6,2018

In adult rodents, blockage of MCA is the most frequently used strategy for ischemic stroke study. However, modeling MCA occlusion (MCAo) in postnatal day 0–7 (P0–7) mouse pups for IPS study has not been accomplished. Here we occluded the dMCA by inducing the accumulation of magnetic particles (MPs) administered through the superficial temporal vein of mice between P0 and P7, which we called neonatal or perinatal SIMPLE (Stroke Induced with Magnetic Particles). SIMPLE produced either permanent or transient occlusion in the dMCA of perinatal and neonatal mice. Permanent MCA occlusion with SIMPLE resulted in cerebral infarction and neuronal death in the brain. SIMPLE can also be used to reliably produce focal ischemic stroke in neonatal or perinatal mouse brains. As a result, SIMPLE allows the modeling of IPS or focal ischemic stroke for further mechanistic studies in mice, with particular utility for mimicking transient focal ischemia in human pre-term babies, which for the first time here has been accomplished in mice.","Magnetic force, Magnetic nanoparticles, Ischemic perinatal stroke, Ischemic neonatal stroke, SIMPLE, Distal MCA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0389-0,2018

In several major model species—most notably Drosophila—neurogeneticists identify and isolate neural circuits with a binary heterologous expression-control system: Gal4–UASG. One limitation of Gal4–UASG is that expression patterns are often too broad to map circuits precisely. To help refine the range of Gal4 lines, we developed an intersectional genetic AND operator. Interoperable with Gal4, the new system’s key component is a fusion protein in which the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 has been replaced with a zinc finger domain with a different DNA-binding specificity. In combination with its cognate binding site (UASZ) the zinc-finger-replaced Gal4 (‘Zal1’) was functional as a standalone transcription factor. Zal1 transgenes also refined Gal4 expression ranges when combined with UASGZ, a hybrid upstream activation sequence. In this way, combining Gal4 and Zal1 drivers captured restricted cell sets compared with single drivers and improved genetic fidelity. This intersectional genetic AND operation presumably derives from the action of a heterodimeric transcription factor: Gal4-Zal1. Configurations of Zal1–UASZ and Zal1-Gal4-UASGZ are versatile tools for defining, refining, and manipulating targeted neural expression patterns with precision.","Expression Range, Upstream Activation Sequence, Mushroom Bodies, GAL4 Driver, Corazonin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0390-7,2018
Multiple myosin motors interact with sodium/potassium-ATPase alpha 1 subunits,"Bhagirathi Dash1,2,3,, Sulayman D. Dib-Hajj1,2,3 &, Stephen G. Waxman1,2,3",Stephen G. Waxman,stephen.waxman@yale.edu,2018-08-07,"The alpha1 (α1) subunit of the sodium/potassium ATPase (i.e., Na+/K+-ATPase α1), the prototypical sodium pump, is expressed in each eukaryotic cell. They pump out three sodium ions in exchange for two extracellular potassium ions to establish a cellular electrochemical gradient important for firing of neuronal and cardiac action potentials. We hypothesized that myosin (myo or myh) motor proteins might interact with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits in order for them to play an important role in the transport and trafficking of sodium pump. To this end immunoassays were performed to determine whether class II non-muscle myosins (i.e., NMHC-IIA/myh9, NMHC-IIB/myh10 or NMHC-IIC/myh14), myosin Va (myoVa) and myosin VI (myoVI) would interact with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. Immunoprecipitation of myh9, myh10, myh14, myoVa and myoVI from rat brain tissues led to the co-immunoprecipitation of Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits expressed there. Heterologous expression studies using HEK293 cells indicated that recombinant myh9, myh10, myh14 and myoVI interact with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. Additional results indicated that loss of tail regions in recombinant myh9, myh10, myh14 and myoVI did not affect their interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. However, recombinant myh9, myh10 and myh14 mutants having reduced or no actin binding ability, as a result of loss of their actin binding sites, displayed greatly reduced or null interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. These results suggested the involvement of the actin binding site, but not tail regions, of NMHC-IIs in their interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. Overall these results suggest a role for these diverse myosins in the trafficking and transport of sodium pump in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.","Myosins, Class II non-muscle myosins, myh9, myh10, myh14, Myosin Va, Myosin VI, Sodium/potassium ATPase, Sodium pump, Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0388-1,2018

These structural characteristics help in identifying the activity state of the neuron and should be taken into consideration when interpreting ultrastructural features of the neurons. Here in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures where experimental conditions can be easily manipulated, two additional features are documented in forebrain neurons as reliable benchmarks for stimulation-induced structural changes: (1) The neuronal nucleus showed conspicuous clustering of dark chromatin, and (2) the endoplasmic reticulum formed stacks with a uniform gap of ~ 13 nm filled with dark materials. Both structural changes progressed with time and were reversible upon returning the slice cultures to control medium. These stimulation-induced structural changes were also verified in dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures and perfusion-fixed brains. In hippocampal slice cultures, the neuronal chromatin clustering was detectable within 30 s of depolarization with high K+ (90 mM) or treatment with NMDA (50 μM). In contrast, the formation of ER cisternal stacks did not become apparent for another 30 s. Importantly, in dissociated neuronal cultures, when the extracellular calcium was chelated by EGTA, treatment with high K+ no longer induced these changes. These results indicate that the stimulation-induced chromatin clustering and formation of ER stacks in neurons are calcium-dependent. Additionally, mitochondria in neuronal somas of tissue culture samples consistently became swollen upon stimulation. However, swollen mitochondria were also present in some neurons of control samples, but could be eliminated by blocking basal activity or calcium influx. This calcium-dependent structural change of mitochondria is specific to neurons. These structural changes may bring insights to the neuron’s response to intracellular calcium rise upon stimulation.","Electron microscopy, ER, Calcium regulation, Chromatin, Nucleus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0387-2,2018

NFs function by determining axonal caliber, promoting axonal growth and forming a 3-dimensional lattice that supports the organization of cytoplasmic organelles. The stoichiometry of NF protein subunits (NFL, NFM and NFH) has to be tightly controlled to avoid the formation of NF neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), axonal degeneration and neuronal death, all pathological hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The post-transcriptional control of NF transcripts is critical for regulating normal levels of NF proteins. Previously, we showed that miRNAs that are dysregulated in ALS spinal cord regulate the levels of NEFL mRNA. In order to complete the understanding of altered NF expression in ALS, in this study we have investigated the regulation of NEFM and NEFH mRNA levels by miRNAs. We observed that a small group of ALS-linked miRNAs that are expressed in human spinal motor neurons directly regulate NEFM and NEFH transcript levels in a manner that is associated with an increase in NFM and NFH protein levels in ALS spinal cord homogenates. In concert with previous observations demonstrating the suppression of NEFL mRNA steady state levels in ALS, these observations provide support for the hypothesis that the dysregulation of miRNAs in spinal motor neurons in ALS fundamentally alters the stoichiometry of NF expression, leading to the formation of pathological NCIs.","ALS, miRNA, Motor neuron, Neurofilament, NEFM, NEFH",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0386-3,2018

PPI is measured to assess sensorimotor gating across species, including humans and rodents. Reduced PPI, which is thought to reflect dysfunction of sensorimotor gating, is reported in patients with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and in animal models of these disorders. Individual differences in basal startle reactivity occur even in a genetically homogenous group of animals; however, there is limited information regarding whether basal levels of the startle response are associated with variations in PPI levels. Here, to explore the relationship between an acoustic startle response (ASR) and PPI, we performed a meta-analysis of data obtained from more than 1300 C57BL/6J male mice on the influence of an ASR to 110- and 120-dB startle stimuli on the PPI levels of the ASR at 74- and 78-dB prepulse intensities. Examination of scatter plots of the ASR amplitudes and PPI levels followed by correlation analyses indicated that there is no simple linear relationship between the two measures; when mice were divided into three groups on the basis of their startle amplitudes, there were positive correlations between the amplitude of the ASR to the 110-dB stimulus and PPI levels in a group of mice that showed lower ASR amplitudes among the genetically homogenous group, whereas no significant correlations were identified in groups of mice that showed intermediate and higher ASR amplitudes. As indicated by the correlation analysis, the lowest responders to the 110-dB stimulus exhibited lower levels of PPI than the intermediate or higher responders. In contrast, for the 120-dB stimulus, a negative correlation was identified between the amplitude of the ASR to the 120-dB stimulus and the PPI levels in the groups of mice that showed intermediate or higher ASR amplitudes. Lower and intermediate responders showed higher levels of PPI than higher responders to the 120-dB stimulus. These findings suggest that basal startle reactivity may affect PPI levels in male C57BL/6J mice, thus representing one potential confounding factor that may confuse the interpretation of PPI results. These findings emphasize the importance of careful examination of startle reactivity to ensure a reliable assessment of PPI.","Acoustic startle response, Prepulse inhibition, Meta-analysis, Behavioral test battery, Mouse phenotype database",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0382-7,2018

The percentages of neurons with strong immunoreactivity of TRAAK, TREK-1 and TREK-2 channels were 27, 23, and 20%, respectively.

In majority of small-sized DRG neurons recorded (76%), large leak K+ currents were observed at 22 °C and were inhibited at 14 °C and potentiated at 30 °C, suggesting the presence of temperature-sensitive K2P channels in these neurons. In a small population (18%) of small-sized DRG neurons, cool temperature of 14 °C evoked a conductance which was consistent with TRPM8 channel activation in cold-sensing DRG neurons. In these DRG neurons, leak K+ currents were very small at 22 °C and were not potentiated at 30 °C, suggesting that few temperature-sensitive K2P channels was present in cold-sensing DRG neurons. For DRG neurons with temperature-sensitive leak K+ currents, riluzole, norfluoxetine and prostaglandin F2α (PGE2α) inhibited the leak K+ currents at both 30 °C and 22 °C degree, and did not have inhibitory effects at 14 °C.

We showed that stimulation with IL-1β increased expression levels of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and neurogenin 1 (Ngn1) and promoted neurite outgrowth. We also found that IL-1β increased mRNA and protein levels of Wnt5a. Knockdown of Wnt5a by transfection with Wnt5a siRNA inhibited IL-1β-induced neuronal differentiation. Moreover, IL-1β-induced Wnt5a expression was regulated by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, which is involved in IL-1β-mediated neuronal differentiation. To examine the role of Wnt5a in neuronal differentiation of NPCs, we exogenously added Wnt5a. We found that exogenous Wnt5a promotes neuronal differentiation, and activates the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)/c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. In addition, Wnt5a-induced neuronal differentiation was blocked by RhoA siRNA, as well as by a specific Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y27632) or a SAPK/JNK inhibitor (SP600125). Furthermore, treatment with RhoA siRNA, Y27632, or SP600125 suppressed the IL-1β-induced neuronal differentiation.

Generally MHC-I is not expressed on healthy post-mitotic neurons in the central nervous system, but it is known to increase upon immune activation such as viral infections and also during neurodegenerative processes. MHC-I expression is known to be regulated by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in non-neuronal cells. Interestingly DNMT1 expression is high in neurons despite these being non-dividing. This suggests a role for DNMT1 in neurons beyond the classical re-methylation of DNA after cell division. We thus investigated whether DNMT1 regulates MHC-I in post-mitotic neurons. For this we used primary cultures of mouse cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Our results showed that knockdown of DNMT1 in CGNs caused upregulation of some, but not all subtypes of MHC-I genes. This effect was synergistically enhanced by subsequent IFNγ treatment. Overall MHC-I protein level was not affected by knockdown of DNMT1 in CGNs. Instead our results show that the relative MHC-I expression levels among the different MHC subtypes is regulated by DNMT1 activity. In conclusion, we show that while the mouse H2-D1/L alleles are suppressed in neurons by DNMT1 activity under normal circumstances, the H2-K1 allele is not. This finding is particularly important in two instances. One: in the context of CNS autoimmunity with epitope presentation by specific MHC-I subtypes where this allele specific regulation might become important; and two: in amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) where H2-K but not H2-D protects motor neurons from ALS astrocyte-induced toxicity in a mouse model of ALS.","MHC class I, Post mitotic neurons, DNMT1, HLA, H2, Autoimmune neurodegeneration",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0380-9,2018

They fall into a long-lasting drowsy state, as reflected by repeated and open-eyed nodding of the head while in a standing position. Simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and neck electromyogram (EMG) readouts revealed that this drowsy state including nodding state had multiple stages in terms of the relationship between the level of vigilance and head movement: delta oscillations decreased in power prior to the head-nodding period and increased during the non-nodding period. Cav3.1-knockout mice, which have reduced delta oscillations, showed frequent head nodding with reduced duration of nodding episodes compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that the balance of drive is tilted in favor of wakefulness, likely due to their previously proposed decrease in sleep-promoting functions.

We hypothesize that reversible photobleaching is related to cis-trans isomerization and protonation of the GFP chromophore of ASAP proteins.

Here, we generated a novel transgenic mouse line with neuroligin-2 (NL2) R215H mutation. The single point mutation caused a significant loss of NL2 protein in vivo, reduced GABAergic transmission, and impaired hippocampal activation. Importantly, R215H KI mice displayed anxiety-like behavior, impaired pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), cognition deficits and abnormal stress responses, recapitulating several key aspects of schizophrenia-like behaviors.

Recent studies have shown that mutations in SQSTM1 are linked to ALS. SQSTM1 encodes SQSTM1/p62 that regulates not only autophagy via the association with MAP1LC3/LC3 and ubiquitinated proteins but also the KEAP1-NFE2L2/Nrf2 anti-oxidative stress pathway by interacting with KEAP1. Previously, we have demonstrated that loss of SQSTM1 exacerbates disease phenotypes in a SOD1H46R-expressing ALS mouse model. To clarify the effects of SQSTM1 overexpression in this model, we generated SQSTM1 and SOD1H46R double-transgenic (SQSTM1;SOD1H46R) mice. SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice exhibited earlier disease onset and shorter lifespan than did SOD1H46R mice. Conversely, disease progression after the onset rather slightly but significantly slowed in SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice. However, there were observable differences neither in the number of Nissl positive neurons nor in the distribution of ubiquitin-positive and/or SQSTM1-positive aggregates between SOD1H46R and SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice. It was noted that these protein aggregates were mainly observed in neuropil, and partly localized to astrocytes and/or microglia, but not to MAP2-positive neuronal cell bodies and dendrites at the end-stage of disease. Nonetheless, the biochemically-detectable insoluble SQSTM1 and poly-ubiquitinated proteins were significantly and progressively increased in the spinal cord of SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice compared to SOD1H46R mice. These results suggest that overexpression of SQSTM1 in SOD1H46R mice accelerates disease onset by compromising the protein degradation pathways.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, SOD1, SQSTM1/p62, Ubiquitin-positive aggregates",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0373-8,2018

Despite the fact that increased α-SYN levels are considered one of the key contributors in developing PD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of α-SYN still needs to be elucidated. Since the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have important roles in translation, localization, and stability of mRNAs through RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), it is important to identify the exact length of 3′UTRs of transcripts in order to understand the precise regulation of gene expression. Currently annotated human α-SYN mRNA has a relatively long 3′UTR (2529 nucleotides [nt]) with several isoforms. RNA-sequencing and epigenomics data have suggested, however, the possible existence of even longer transcripts which extend beyond the annotated α-SYN 3′UTR sequence. Here, we have discovered the novel extended form of α-SYN 3′UTR (3775 nt) in the substantia nigra of human postmortem brain samples, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons, and other human neuronal cell lines. Interestingly, the longer variant reduced α-SYN translation. The extended α-SYN 3′UTR was significantly lower in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from sporadic PD patients than controls. On the other hand, α-SYN protein levels were much higher in PD cases, showing the strong negative correlation with the extended 3′UTR. These suggest that dysregulation of the extended α-SYN 3′UTR might contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.","Parkinson’s disease, Alpha-synuclein, 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR), mRNA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0371-x,2018

Restoring the feeding pattern is sufficient to prevent HFD-induced obesity in mice. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying HFD-induced feeding pattern disturbances remain elusive. Saturated fatty acids activate microglia and cause hypothalamic inflammation. Activated microglia cause neuroinflammation, which spreads via inflammatory cytokines and gap-junction hemichannels. However, the role of gap-junction hemichannels in HFD-induced obesity remains unaddressed. We used a novel, central-acting connexin inhibitor, INI-0602, which has high affinity for gap junction hemichannels and does not affect the induction of inflammatory cytokines. We analyzed ad libitum feeding behavior and locomotor activity in mice that were fed normal chow (NC), a HFD with elevated saturated fatty acids (SFAs), or a HFD with very high SFAs. We found that HFD feeding induced acute hyperphagia, mainly during the light cycle. Feeding pattern disturbances were more pronounced in mice that consumed the HFD with very high SFAs than in mice that consumed the HFD with elevated SFAs. When INI-0602 was administered before the HFD was introduced, it blocked the feeding pattern disturbance, but not locomotor activity disturbances; moreover, it prevented subsequent diet-induced obesity. However, when INI-0602 was administered after the HFD had disturbed the feeding pattern, it failed to restore the normal feeding pattern. Therefore, we propose that SFAs in HFDs played a major role in disrupting feeding patterns in mice. Moreover, the feeding pattern disturbance required the function of central, gap junction hemichannels at the initiation of a HFD. However, altering hemichannel function after the feeding pattern disturbance was established had no effect. Thus, preventing the occurrence of a feeding pattern disturbance by blocking the hemichannel pathway was associated with the prevention of the HFD-induced obesity in mice.","Diet-induced obesity, Feeding clock, Feeding rhythm, Gap junction, Hyperphagia, Hypothalamic inflammation, Microglia, Saturated fatty acids",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0372-9,2018

Previous genomic analyses suggested their possible involvement in the etiology of schizophrenia. We recently demonstrated the development of an ectopic cortical mass (ECM), which resembles the human subcortical band heterotopia, in the dorsal telencephalon-specific Rapgef2 conditional knockout (Rapgef2-cKO) brains. Additional knockout of Rapgef6 in Rapgef2-cKO mice resulted in gross enlargement of the ECM whereas knockout of Rapgef6 alone (Rapgef6-KO) had no discernible effect on the brain morphology. Here, we performed a battery of behavioral tests to examine the effects of Rapgef2 or Rapgef6 deficiency on higher brain functions. Rapgef2-cKO mice exhibited hyperlocomotion phenotypes. They showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and the open-field tests as well as increased depression-like behavior in the Porsolt forced swim and tail suspension tests. They also exhibited increased sociability especially in novel environments. They showed defects in cognitive function as evidenced by reduced learning ability in the Barnes circular maze test and by impaired working memory in the T maze tests. In contrast, although Rapgef6 and Rapgef2 share similarities in biochemical roles, Rapgef6-KO mice exhibited mild behavioral abnormalities detected with a number of behavioral tests, such as hyperlocomotion phenotype in the open-field test and the social interaction test with a novel environment and working-memory defects in the T-maze test. In conclusion, although there were differences in their brain morphology and the magnitude of the behavioral abnormalities, Rapgef2-cKO mice and Rapgef6-KO mice exhibited hyperlocomotion phenotype and working-memory defect, both of which could be recognized as schizophrenia-like behavior.","Rap small GTPases, Guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Rapgef2, Rapgef6, Behavioral analysis, Schizophrenia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0370-y,2018
Naked mole-rat cortical neurons are resistant to acid-induced cell death,"Zoé Husson1 &, Ewan St. John Smith1",Ewan St. John Smith,es336@cam.ac.uk,2018-05-09,"Regulation of brain pH is a critical homeostatic process and changes in brain pH modulate various ion channels and receptors and thus neuronal excitability. Tissue acidosis, resulting from hypoxia or hypercapnia, can activate various proteins and ion channels, among which acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) a family of primarily Na+ permeable ion channels, which alongside classical excitotoxicity causes neuronal death. Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance. In the central nervous system, ASIC subunit expression is similar between mouse and NMR with the exception of much lower expression of ASIC4 throughout the NMR brain. However, ASIC function and neuronal sensitivity to sustained acidosis has not been examined in the NMR brain. Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are reversibly blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.","ASIC, Acid-induced currents, Acidotoxicity, Naked mole-rat, Hippocampus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0369-4,2018

We recently showed that depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) impairs remyelination in vivo, and that Treg-secreted factors directly enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation. Here we aim to further characterize the dynamics of Treg-enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation as well as elucidate the cellular components of a murine mixed neuron-glia model.Murine mixed neuron-glia cultures were generated from P2–7 C57BL/6 mice and characterized for percentage of neuronal and glial cell populations prior to treatment at 7 days in vitro (div) as well as after treatment with Treg-conditioned media at multiple timepoints up to 12 div.Mixed neuron-glia cultures consisted of approximately 30% oligodendroglial lineage cells, 20% neurons and 10% microglia.

Treatment with Treg-conditioned media enhanced the proportion of MBP+ oligodendrocytes and decreased the proportion of PDGFRα+ OPCs, but did not affect OPC proliferation or survival. Treg-enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation was not caused by Treg polarizing factors, was dependent on the number of activation cycles Treg underwent and was robustly achieved by using 5% conditioned media.These studies provide in-depth characterization of a murine mixed neuron-glia model as well as further insights into the dynamics of Treg-enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation.","Murine mixed glia, OPC, Oligodendrocyte, Treg",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0367-6,2018

The number and average length of SSC-PM contact areas in neuronal somas significantly decreased within 30 s under excitatory condition. This decrease in SSC-PM contact area progressed with time and was reversible. These results demonstrate a structural decoupling between the SSC and the PM upon stimulation, suggesting that there may be a functional decoupling of the calcium regulation.

Genetic deletion or chronic pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 by the negative allosteric modulator CTEP, rescues cognitive function and reduces Aβ aggregation in both APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mouse models of AD. In late onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, defects arise at different stages of the autophagy pathway. Here, we show that mGluR5 cell surface expression is elevated in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mice. This is accompanied by reduced autophagy (accumulation of p62) as the consequence of increased ZBTB16 expression and reduced ULK1 activity, as we have previously observed in Huntington’s disease (HD). The chronic (12 week) inhibition of mGluR5 with CTEP in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mice prevents the observed increase in mGluR5 surface expression. In addition, mGluR5 inactivation facilitates the loss of ZBTB16 expression and ULK1 activation as a consequence of ULK-Ser757 dephosphorylation, which promotes the loss of expression of the autophagy marker p62. Moreover, the genetic ablation of mGluR5 in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice activated autophagy via similar mechanisms to pharmacological blockade. This study provides further evidence that mGluR5 overactivation contributes to inhibition of autophagy and can result in impaired clearance of neurotoxic aggregates in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it provides additional support for the potential of mGluR5 inhibition as a general therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and HD.","GPCR, mGluR5, Alzheimer’s disease, APPswe/PS1ΔE9, 3xTg-AD, CTEP, ULK1, ZBTB16, Autophagy",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0364-9,2018

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, MEDLINE, EBSCOHost and Google Scholar and relevant data were submitted to a meta-analysis. Early life stress may contribute to the development of depression and patients with depression are at risk of developing PD later in life. Depression is a common non-motor symptom preceding motor symptoms in PD. Stimulation of regions contiguous to the substantia nigra as well as dopamine (DA) agonists have been shown to be able to attenuate depression. Therefore, since PD causes depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, depression, rather than being just a simple mood disorder, may be part of the pathophysiological process that leads to PD. It is plausible that the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways that mediate mood, emotion, and/or cognitive function may also play a key role in depression associated with PD. Here, we propose that a medication designed to address a deficiency in serotonin is more likely to influence motor symptoms of PD associated with depression.

Employing the ppk-Gal4 line, which is exclusively expressed in mdIV neurons, we further show that silencing duox in mdIV neurons attenuates UV-induced sensitization.ConclusionsOur findings reveal a novel role for duox in nociceptive sensitization of Drosophila larvae, and will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process in Drosophila sensory neurons.","Duox, ROS, Nociception, Drosophila",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0358-7,2018

However, recent research on NMDAR-associated signaling complexes has identified important death-signaling pathways linked to NMDARs. This led to the generation of inhibitors that inhibit these pathways downstream from the receptor without necessarily blocking NMDARs. This therapeutic approach may have fewer side effects and/or provide a wider therapeutic window for stroke as compared to the receptor antagonists. In this review, we highlight the key findings in the signaling cascades downstream of NMDARs and the novel promising therapeutics for ischemic stroke.","Ischemic stroke, NMDA receptors, Excitotoxicity, Death signaling complexes, Neuroprotection",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0357-8,2018

Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and behavioral tests were used to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects of RA. The protein and mRNA levels of RARα, PI3K, Akt, Bad, caspase-3, caspase-8, Bcl-2, Bax, and Bid were measured with western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. We found impairments in learning and spatial memory in VAD group compared with vitamin A normal (VAN) and vitamin A supplemented (VAS) group. Additionally, we showed that hippocampal apoptosis was weaker in the VAN group than that in VAD group. Relative to the VAD group, the VAN group also had increased mRNA and protein levels of RARα and PI3K, and upregulated phosphorylated Akt/Bad levels in vivo. In vitro, excessively low or high RA signaling promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, the effects on apoptosis involved the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). These data support the idea that sustained VAD following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) inhibits RARα, which downregulates the PI3K/Akt/Bad and Bcl-2/Bax pathways and upregulates the caspase-8/Bid pathway to influence the MMP, ultimately producing deficits in learning and spatial memory in adolescence.

In this study, we examined TLR4 and its association with autophagic activity using a chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain model in wild-type (WT) and TLR4-knockout (KO) mice. The mice were assigned into four groups: WT-Contralateral (Contra), WT-Ipsilateral (Ipsi), TLR4 KO-Contra, and TLR4 KO-Ipsi. Behavioral and mechanical allodynia tests and biochemical analysis of spinal cord tissue were conducted following CCI to the sciatic nerve. Compared with the Contra group, mechanical allodynia in both the WT- and TLR4 KO-Ipsi groups was significantly increased, and a marked decrease of allodynia was observed in the TLR4 KO-Ipsi group. Although glial cells were upregulated in the WT-Ipsi group, no significant change was observed in the TLR4 KO groups. Moreover, protein expression and immunoreactive cell regulation of autophagy (Beclin 1, p62) were significantly increased in the neurons, but not microglia, of WT-Ipsi group compared with the WT-Contra group. The level of PINK1, a marker for mitophagy was increased in the neurons of WT, but not in TLR4 KO mice.

Soluble Aβ1–42 increases the heterogeneity in synaptic vesicle pool size among synapses by suppressing intersynaptic vesicle sharing,"Daehun Park1 &, Sunghoe Chang1,2",Sunghoe Chang,sunghoe@snu.ac.kr,2018-02-20,"Growing evidence has indicated that prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid beta (sAβ1–42) is the major causative factor in the synaptic dysfunction associated with AD. The molecular changes leading to presynaptic dysfunction caused by sAβ1–42, however, still remains elusive. Recently, we found that sAβ1–42 inhibits chemically induced long-term potentiation-induced synaptogenesis by suppressing the intersynaptic vesicle trafficking through calcium (Ca2+) dependent hyperphosphorylation of synapsin and CaMKIV. However, it is still unclear how sAβ1–42 increases intracellular Ca2+ that induces hyperphosphorylation of CaMKIV and synapsin, and what is the functional consequences of sAβ1–42-induced defects in intersynaptic vesicle trafficking in physiological conditions. In this study, we showed that sAβ1–42elevated intracellular Ca2+ through not only extracellular Ca2+ influx but also Ca2+ release from mitochondria. Surprisingly, without Ca2+ release from mitochondria, sAβ1–42 failed to increase intracellular Ca2+ even in the presence of normal extracellular Ca2+. We further found that sAβ1–42-induced mitochondria Ca2+ release alone sufficiently increased Serine 9 phosphorylation of synapsin. By blocking synaptic vesicle reallocation, sAβ1–42 significantly increased heterogeneity of total synaptic vesicle pool size among synapses. Together, our results suggested that by disrupting the axonal vesicle trafficking, sAβ1–42 disabled neurons to adjust synaptic pool sizes among synapses, which might prevent homeostatic rescaling in synaptic strength of individual neurons.","Vesicle Pool Size, Presynaptic Dysfunction, Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase Kinase (CaMKK), Days In Vitro (DIV8), Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0353-z,2018

Cerebral I/R caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) was established in Sprague-Dawley rats. First, in rats fed a regular diet, the MCAO/R stimulus led to a significant decrease in endogenous production of RvD2. Exogenous supply of RvD2 via intraperitoneal injection reversed MCAO/R-induced brain injury, including infarction, inflammatory response, brain edema, and neurological dysfunction. Meanwhile, RvD2 reversed the MCAO/R-induced decrease in the protein level of GPR18, which has been identified as a receptor for RvD2, especially in neurons and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). Furthermore, RvD2 exerted rescue effects on MCAO/R-induced neuron and BMVEC death. Moreover, GPR18 antagonist O-1918 could block the rescue effects of RvD2, possibly at least partially though the GPR18-ERK1/2-NOS signaling pathway. Finally, compared with ω-3 fatty acid supplements, RvD2 treatment had a better rescue effect on cerebral infarction, which may be due to the MCAO/R-induced decrease in 5-lipoxygense phosphorylation and subsequent RvD2 generation. In conclusion, compared with ω-3 fatty acids, RvD2 may be an optimal alternative and complementary treatment for ischemic stroke patients with recanalization treatment.","Ischemic stroke, Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, Resolvin D2, ω-3 fatty acid, GPR18, Neuron, Brain microvascular endothelial cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0351-1,2018

However, AD is also characterised by reductions in secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPα), an alternative cleavage product of APP. In contrast to the neurotoxicity of accumulated Αβ, sAPPα has many neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties. Increasing sAPPα levels has the potential to serve as a therapeutic treatment that mitigates the effects of Aβ and rescue cognitive function. Here we tested the hypothesis that lentivirus-mediated expression of a human sAPPα construct in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1dE9), begun before the onset of plaque pathology, could prevent later behavioural and electrophysiological deficits. Male mice were given bilateral intra-hippocampal injections at 4 months of age and tested 8–10 months later. Transgenic mice expressing sAPPα performed significantly better than untreated littermates in all aspects of the spatial water maze task. Expression of sAPPα also resulted in partial rescue of long-term potentiation (LTP), tested in vitro. These improvements occurred in the absence of changes in amyloid pathology. Supporting these findings on LTP, lentiviral-mediated expression of sAPPα for 3 months from 10 months of age, or acute sAPPα treatment in hippocampal slices from 18 to 20 months old transgenic mice, completely reversed the deficits in LTP. Together these findings suggest that sAPPα has wide potential to act as either a preventative or restorative therapeutic treatment in AD by mitigating the effects of Aβ toxicity and enhancing cognitive reserve.","Amyloid precursor protein, Lentivirus, Hippocampus, Memory, Long-term potentiation, Amyloid, APP/PS1 mouse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0348-9,2018

Foxg1 is critical for the development of the telencephalon, but its role in diencephalic development has been under-investigated. Patients suffering from FOXG1-related disorders exhibit severe anxiety, sleep disturbance and choroid plexus cysts, indicating that Foxg1 likely plays a role in epithalamic development.

The innervations, particularly the habenular commissure, were severely impaired. Meanwhile, the Foxg1 mutants exhibited a reduced pineal gland and more branched choroid plexus.

Inferior colliculus (IC) neurons receive glycinergic and GABAergic inputs, whereas inhibition in hippocampus (HC) predominantly relies on GABA. Astrocytes heterogeneously express neurotransmitter transporters and are expected to adapt to the local requirements regarding neurotransmitter homeostasis. Here we analyzed the expression of inhibitory neurotransmitter transporters in IC and HC astrocytes using whole-cell patch-clamp and single-cell reverse transcription-PCR. We show that most astrocytes in both regions expressed functional glycine transporters (GlyTs). Activation of these transporters resulted in an inward current (IGly) that was sensitive to the competitive GlyT1 agonist sarcosine. Astrocytes exhibited transcripts for GlyT1 but not for GlyT2. Glycine did not alter the membrane resistance (RM) arguing for the absence of functional glycine receptors (GlyRs). Thus, IGly was mainly mediated by GlyT1. Similarly, we found expression of functional GABA transporters (GATs) in all IC astrocytes and about half of the HC astrocytes. These transporters mediated an inward current (IGABA) that was sensitive to the competitive GAT-1 and GAT-3 antagonists NO711 and SNAP5114, respectively. Accordingly, transcripts for GAT-1 and GAT-3 were found but not for GAT-2 and BGT-1. Only in hippocampal astrocytes, GABA transiently reduced RM demonstrating the presence of GABAA receptors (GABAARs). However, IGABA was mainly not contaminated by GABAAR-mediated currents as RM changes vanished shortly after GABA application. In both regions, IGABA was stronger than IGly. Furthermore, in HC the IGABA/IGly ratio was larger compared to IC. Taken together, our results demonstrate that astrocytes are heterogeneous across and within distinct brain areas.

In embryonic mouse spinal organ-cultures, containing neuronal cells and neuroglia, cytokines induced inflammatory responses accompanied by a significant increase in spontaneous synaptic activity. We suggest that cytokines specifically altered signal integration in spinal networks by speeding the decay of GABAA responses. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that synapse protection by a non-peptidic NGF mimetic molecule prevented both the changes in the time course of GABA events and in network activity that were left unchanged by the cytokine production from astrocytes and microglia present in the cultured tissue.

Warburg effect hypothesis in autism Spectrum disorders,"Alexandre Vallée1,2 &, Jean-Noël Vallée2,3",Alexandre Vallée,alexandre.g.vallee@gmail.com,2018-01-04,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by a deficit in social interactions and communication with repetitive and restrictive behavior. In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen.

We show that loss of the Drosophila PDZ guanine nucleotide exchange factor Gef26 significantly increases synaptic growth at the NMJ and enhances BMP signaling in motor neurons. We further show that Gef26 functions upstream of Rap1 in motor neurons to restrain synaptic growth. Synaptic overgrowth in gef26 or rap1 mutants requires BMP signaling, indicating that Gef26 and Rap1 regulate synaptic growth via inhibition of BMP signaling. We also show that Gef26 is involved in the endocytic downregulation of surface expression of the BMP receptors thickveins (Tkv) and wishful thinking (Wit). Finally, we demonstrate that loss of Gef26 also induces progressive brain neurodegeneration through Rap1- and BMP signaling-dependent mechanisms.

Calpain is a Ca2+-dependent protease that exerts its effects through the proteolytic cleavage of target proteins. Neuron-specific conditional deletions of calpain 1 and 2 impair long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and spatial learning. Moreover, recent studies have suggested distinct roles of calpain 1 and 2 in synaptic plasticity. However, the role of hippocampal calpain in memory processes, especially memory consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction, is still unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated the critical roles of hippocampal calpain in the consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of contextual fear memory in mice. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of calpain in the hippocampus on these memory processes, using the N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN; calpain 1 and 2 inhibitor). Microinfusion of ALLN into the dorsal hippocampus impaired long-term memory (24 h memory) without affecting short-term memory (2 h memory). Similarly, this pharmacological blockade of calpain in the dorsal hippocampus also disrupted reactivated memory but did not affect memory extinction. Importantly, the systemic administration of ALLN inhibited the induction of c-fos in the hippocampus, which is observed when memory is consolidated. Our observations showed that hippocampal calpain is required for the consolidation and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory. Further, the results suggested that calpain contributes to the regulation of new gene expression that is necessary for these memory processes as a regulator of Ca2+-signal transduction pathway.","Calpain, Hippocampus, Fear conditioning, ALLN, c-fos",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0341-8,2017

In the present study, we have characterized the excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the adult tree shrew, a key cortical region for pain perception and emotion. We found that glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter for fast synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic responses induced by local stimulation were mediated by AMPA and kainate (KA) receptors. As compared with mice, AMPA and KA receptor mediated responses were significantly greater. Interestingly, the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in tree shrews was significantly less than that of mice. Moreover, both the ratio of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the time of 50% decay for fast blockade of NMDA receptor mediated EPSCs were greater in the tree shrew. Finally, tree shrew neurons showed higher initial firing frequency and neuronal excitability with a cell type-specific manner in the ACC.

While accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hyper-phosphorylation of tau are parts of the etiology, AD can be caused by a large number of different genetic mutations and other unknown factors. Considering such a heterogeneous nature of AD, it would be desirable to develop treatment strategies that can improve memory irrespective of the individual causes. Reducing the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) was shown to enhance long-term memory and synaptic plasticity in naïve mice. Moreover, hyper-phosphorylation of eIF2α is observed in the brains of postmortem AD patients. Therefore, regulating eIF2α phosphorylation can be a plausible candidate for restoring memory in AD by targeting memory-enhancing mechanism. In this study, we examined whether PKR inhibition can rescue synaptic and learning deficits in two different AD mouse models; 5XFAD transgenic and Aβ1–42-injected mice. We found that the acute treatment of PKR inhibitor (PKRi) can restore the deficits in long-term memory and long-term potentiation (LTP) in both mouse models without affecting the Aβ load in the hippocampus.

In this study, we conducted three-dimensional morphological analyses in subcellular-scale structures in dentate gyrus granule cells of Shn2 KO mice by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Shn2 KO mice showed immature dendritic spine morphology characterized by increases in spine length and decreases in spine diameter. There was a non-significant tendency toward decrease in spine density of Shn2 KO mice over wild-type mice, and spine volume was indistinguishable between genotypes.

Substantial evidence suggests that memory involves learning-dependent changes at synapses, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, understanding the storages process that underlies LTP may provide insight into how the engram is stored. LTP involves induction, maintenance (storage), and expression sub-processes; special tests are required to specifically reveal properties of the storage process. The strongest of these is the Erasure test in which a transiently applied agent that attacks a putative storage molecule may lead to persistent erasure of previously induced LTP/memory. Two major hypotheses have been proposed for LTP/memory storage: the CaMKII and PKM-zeta hypotheses. After discussing the tests that can be used to identify the engram (Necessity test, Saturation/Occlusion test, Erasure test), the status of these hypotheses is evaluated, based on the literature on LTP and memory-guided behavior. Review of the literature indicates that all three tests noted above support the CaMKII hypothesis when done at both the LTP level and at the behavioral level. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the engram is stored by an LTP process in which CaMKII is a critical memory storage molecule.","Herpes simplex virus, K42 M, Place aversion, Occlusion, Memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0337-4,2017

CNVs affect gene expression by altering the genome structure and transposable elements within a region. CNVs are greater than 1 kb in size; hence, CNVs can produce more variation than can individual single-nucleotide variations that are detected by next-generation sequencing. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an α-synucleinopathy adult-onset disorder. Pathologically, it is characterized by insoluble aggregation of filamentous α-synuclein in brain oligodendrocytes. Generally, MSA is sporadic, although there are rare cases of familial MSA. In addition, the frequencies of the clinical phenotypes differ considerably among countries. Reports indicate that genetic factors play roles in the mechanisms involved in the pathology and onset of MSA. To evaluate the genetic background of this disorder, we attempted to determine whether there are differences in CNVs between patients with MSA and normal control subjects. We found that the number of CNVs on chromosomes 5, 22, and 4 was increased in MSA; 3 CNVs in non-coding regions were considered risk factors for MSA. Our results show that CNVs in non-coding regions influence the expression of genes through transcription-related mechanisms and potentially increase subsequent structural alterations of chromosomes.

Although Best1 appears to be dynamically regulated, the mechanism of its regulation and modulation is poorly understood. It has been reported that a regulatory protein, 14-3-3 affects the surface expression of numerous membrane proteins in mammalian cells.MethodsThe protein-protein interaction between Best1 and 14-3-3γ was confirmed by yeast-two hybrid assay and BiFC method.

These alterations involve the regulation of both functional and morphological features of dendritic spines, the principal sites of excitatory synaptic contact. New protein synthesis has been implicated extensively in the functional changes observed following long-term potentiation (LTP), and changes to spine morphology have similarly been documented extensively following synaptic potentiation. However, mechanistic links between de novo translation and the structural changes of potentiated spines are less clear. Here, we assess explicitly the potential contribution of new protein translation under control of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to LTP-associated changes in spine morphology. Utilizing genetic and pharmacological manipulations of mTORC1 function in combination with confocal microscopy in live dissociated hippocampal cultures, we demonstrate that chemically-induced LTP (cLTP) requires do novo protein synthesis and intact mTORC1 signaling. We observed a striking diversity in response properties across morphological classes, with mushroom spines displaying a particular sensitivity to altered mTORC1 signaling across varied levels of synaptic activity. Notably, while pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 signaling significantly diminished glycine-induced changes in spine morphology, transient genetic upregulation of mTORC1 signaling was insufficient to produce spine enlargements on its own. In contrast, genetic upregulation of mTORC1 signaling promoted rapid expansion in spine head diameter when combined with otherwise sub-threshold synaptic stimulation. These results suggest that synaptic activity-derived signaling pathways act in combination with mTORC1-dependent translational control mechanisms to ultimately regulate changes in spine morphology. As several monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders with links to Autism and Intellectual Disability share a common feature of dysregulated mTORC1 signaling, further understanding of the role of this signaling pathway in regulating synapse function and morphology will be essential in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","Spine Morphology, Mushroom Spines, mTORC1 Signaling, Spine Head Diameter, mTORC1 Activity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0330-y,2017

We previously found that dopamine-deficient (DD) mice became hyperactive in a novel environment 72 h after the last injection of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) when dopamine was almost completely depleted. DD mice did not initially exhibit hyperactivity in their home cages, but the animals exhibited hyperactivity several hours after the last L-DOPA injection. The regulation of motor activity in a novel environment and in home cages may be different. A previous study reported that DD mice became active again approximately 24 h after the last L-DOPA injection. One speculation was that light/dark phase-dependent spontaneous activity might be maintained despite dopamine deficiency. The present study investigated whether spontaneous home cage activity is maintained in DD mice 24–43 h and 72–91 h after the last L-DOPA injection. Spontaneous activity was almost completely suppressed during the light phase of the light/dark cycle in DD mice 24 and 72 h after the last L-DOPA injection. After the dark phase began, DD mice became active 24 and 72 h after the last L-DOPA injection. DD mice exhibited a similar amount of locomotor activity as wildtype mice 24 h after the last L-DOPA injection. Although DD mice presented a decrease in activity 72 h after the last L-DOPA injection, they maintained dark phase-stimulated locomotor activation. Despite low levels of dopamine in DD mice, they exhibited feeding behavior that was similar to wildtype mice. Although grooming and rearing behavior significantly decreased, DD mice retained their ability to perform these activities. Haloperidol treatment significantly suppressed all of these behaviors in wildtype mice but not in DD mice. These results indicate that DD mice maintain some aspects of light/dark phase-dependent spontaneous activity despite dopamine depletion, suggesting that compensatory dopamine-independent mechanisms might play a role in the DD mouse phenotype.","Dopamine, Dopamine-deficient mice, Light/dark phase, Spontaneous activity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0329-4,2017

In the brain, CS proteoglycans are highly concentrated in perineuronal nets (PNNs), which surround synapses and modulate their functions. To investigate the importance of CS, we produced and precisely examined mice that were deficient in the CS synthesizing enzyme, CSGalNAcT1 (T1KO). Biochemical analysis of T1KO revealed that loss of this enzyme reduced the amount of CS by approximately 50% in various brain regions. The amount of CS in PNNs was also diminished in T1KO compared to wild-type mice, although the amount of a major CS proteoglycan core protein, aggrecan, was not changed. In T1KO, we observed abnormalities in several behavioral tests, including the open-field test, acoustic startle response, and social preference. These results suggest that T1 is important for plasticity, probably due to regulation of CS-dependent PNNs, and that T1KO is a good model for investigation of PNNs.","Perineuronal Nets (PNNs), Acoustic Startle Response, Open Field Test, Startle Stimulus, CS Proteoglycans (CSPG)",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0328-5,2017

Hawley,zhawley@uwo.ca,2017-10-02,"Common pathological features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) include cytoplasmic aggregation of several RNA-binding proteins. Out of these RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43, FUS/TLS and RGNEF have been shown to co-aggregate with one another within motor neurons of sporadic ALS (sALS) patients, suggesting that there may be a common regulatory network disrupted. MiRNAs have been a recent focus in ALS research as they have been identified to be globally down-regulated in the spinal cord of ALS patients. The objective of this study was to identify if there are miRNA(s) dysregulated in sALS that are responsible for regulating the TDP-43, FUS/TLS and RGNEF network. In this study, we identify miR-194 and miR-b2122 to be significantly down-regulated in sALS patients, and were predicted to regulate TARDBP, FUS/TLS and RGNEF expression. Reporter gene assays and RT-qPCR revealed that miR-b2122 down-regulates the reporter gene through direct interactions with either the TARDBP, FUS/TLS, or RGNEF 3’UTR, while miR-194 down-regulates firefly expression when it contained either the TARDBP or FUS/TLS 3’UTR. Further, we showed that miR-b2122 regulates endogenous expression of all three of these genes in a neuronal-derived cell line. Also, an ALS-associated mutation in the FUS/TLS 3’UTR ablates the ability of miR-b2122 to regulate reporter gene linked to FUS/TLS 3’UTR, and sALS samples which showed a down-regulation in miR-b2122 also showed an increase in FUS/TLS protein expression. Overall, we have identified a novel miRNA that is down-regulated in sALS that appears to be a central regulator of disease-related RNA-binding proteins, and thus its dysregulation likely contributes to TDP-43, FUS/TLS and RGNEF pathogenesis in sALS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Motor neuron, miRNAs, TDP-43, FUS/TLS, RGNEF, mRNA stability, MotomiRs, Neurodegeneration",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0326-7,2017
Role of GABAA receptors in alcohol use disorders suggested by chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) rodent model,"Richard W. Olsen1 &, Jing Liang1,2",Richard W. Olsen,rolsen@mednet.ucla.edu,2017-09-20,"GABAergic inhibitory transmission is involved in the acute and chronic effects of ethanol on the brain and behavior. One-dose ethanol exposure induces transient plastic changes in GABAA receptor subunit levels, composition, and regional and subcellular localization. Rapid down-regulation of early responder δ subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtypes mediating ethanol-sensitive tonic inhibitory currents in critical neuronal circuits corresponds to rapid tolerance to ethanol’s behavioral responses. Slightly slower, α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtypes mediating ethanol-insensitive synaptic inhibition are down-regulated, corresponding to tolerance to additional ethanol behaviors plus cross-tolerance to other GABAergic drugs including benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and neurosteroids, especially sedative-hypnotic effects. Compensatory up-regulation of synaptically localized α4 and α2 subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtypes, mediating ethanol-sensitive synaptic inhibitory currents follow, but exhibit altered physio-pharmacology, seizure susceptibility, hyperexcitability, anxiety, and tolerance to GABAergic positive allosteric modulators, corresponding to heightened alcohol withdrawal syndrome. All these changes (behavioral, physiological, and biochemical) induced by ethanol administration are transient and return to normal in a few days. After chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment the same changes are observed but they become persistent after 30 or more doses, lasting for at least 120 days in the rat, and probably for life. We conclude that the ethanol-induced changes in GABAA receptors represent aberrant plasticity contributing critically to ethanol dependence and increased voluntary consumption. We suggest that the craving, drug-seeking, and increased consumption in the rat model are tied to ethanol-induced plastic changes in GABAA receptors, importantly the development of ethanol-sensitive synaptic GABAA receptor-mediating inhibitory currents that participate in maintained positive reward actions of ethanol on critical neuronal circuits. These probably disinhibit nerve endings of inhibitory GABAergic neurons on dopamine reward circuit cells, and limbic system circuits mediating anxiolysis in hippocampus and amygdala. We further suggest that the GABAA receptors contributing to alcohol dependence in the rat and presumably in human alcohol use disorders (AUD) are the ethanol-induced up-regulated subtypes containing α4 and most importantly α2 subunits. These mediate critical aspects of the positive reinforcement of ethanol in the dependent chronic user while alleviating heightened withdrawal symptoms experienced whenever ethanol is absent. The speculative conclusions based on firm observations are readily testable.","GABAA receptors, Rodent model of alcoholism, Chronic intermittent ethanol, Inhibitory synaptic plasticity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0325-8,2017

Although many victims are initially resuscitated, they often suffer from serious brain injury, even leading to a “persistent vegetative state”. Therefore, it is need to explore therapies which restore and protect brain function after cardiac arrest. In the present study, using Tg (HuC:GCaMP5) zebrafish as a model, we found the zebrafish brain generated a burst of Ca2+ wave after cardiac arrest by in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging. The Ca2+ wave was firstly initiated at hindbrain and then sequentially propagated to midbrain and telencephalon, the neuron displayed Ca2+ overload after Ca2+ wave propagation. Consistent with this, our study further demonstrated neuronal apoptosis was increased in cardiac arrest zebrafish by TUNEL staining. The cardiac arrest-induced Ca2+ wave propagation can be prevented by general anesthetics such as midazolam or ketamine pretreatment. Moreover, midazolam or ketamine pretreatment dramatically decreased the neuronal apoptosis and improved the survival rate in CA zebrafish. Taken together, these findings provide the first in vivo evidence that general anesthetics pretreatment protects against cardiac arrest-induced brain injury by inhibiting calcium wave propagation in zebrafish.","General anesthetics, Ca2+ wave, Cardiac arrest, Brain injury, Zebrafish",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0323-x,2017

Glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane into the synaptic cleft. Across the synaptic cleft glutamate binds to both ion channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors at the postsynapse, which expedite downstream signalling in the neuron. The postsynaptic density, a highly specialized matrix, which is attached to the postsynaptic membrane, controls this downstream signalling. The postsynaptic density also resets the synapse after each synaptic firing. It is composed of numerous proteins including a family of Discs large associated protein 1, 2, 3 and 4 (DLGAP1-4) that act as scaffold proteins in the postsynaptic density. They link the glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane to other glutamate receptors, to signalling proteins and to components of the cytoskeleton. With the central localisation in the postsynapse, the DLGAP family seems to play a vital role in synaptic scaling by regulating the turnover of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in response to synaptic activity. DLGAP family has been directly linked to a variety of psychological and neurological disorders.

The electrical current excites thalamocortical activity which is controlled by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT). Previous studies showed that enhancing GABAergic inhibitory strength in the nRT reduces the duration and power of seizures, indicating that the thalamus plays an important role in modulating cortical seizures. The aim of the present study was to apply optogenetics to study the role of the nRT in modulating cortical seizures. We used PV-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice from Jackson Laboratories, in which only Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is expressed in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Cortical seizure-like activity was induced by electrical stimulation of the corpus callosum after applying 4-aminopyridine. ChR2 expression was abundant in the nRT and cerebellum in PV-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice. Light stimulation in the nRT caused burst firing in regions of the thalamus and nRT in vitro. Multi-unit activity increased during high-frequency (100 and 50 Hz) light stimulation in the S1 region and thalamus in vivo. Corpus callosum stimulation-induced seizure-like activity was effectively suppressed by high-frequency (100 Hz) and long-duration (10 s) light stimulation. The suppressive effects were reversed by applying a GABAB receptor antagonist but not a GABAA receptor antagonist in the cortex. The results indicated that light stimulation affected thalamocortical relay neurons by activating ChR2-expression neurons in the nRT. High-frequency and long-duration light stimulation was more effective in suppressing cortical seizure-like activity.

Here, we investigate the role of Moesin in neuronal morphogenesis and in short- and long-term memory formation in the courtship suppression assay, a model of associative memory. We found that both knockdown and overexpression of Moesin led to defects in axon growth and guidance as well as dendritic arborization. Moreover, reduction of Moesin expression or expression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic in the adult Drosophila brain had no effect on short term memory, but prevented long-term memory formation, an effect that was independent of its role in development.

This raised the possibility that endogenous activation of mGlu2 receptors contributes to the pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal damage. Here, we examined this possibility using two models of transient focal ischemia: (i) the monofilament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice, and (ii) the model based on intracerebral infusion of endothelin-1 (Et-1) in rats. Following transient MCAO, mGlu2 receptor knockout mice showed a significant reduction in infarct volume and an improved short-term behavioural outcome, as assessed by a neurological disability scale and the “grip test”. Following Et-1 infusion, Grm2 gene mutated Hannover Wistar rats lacking mGlu2 receptors did not show changes in the overall infarct volume as compared to their wild-type counterparts, although they showed a reduced infarct area in the agranular insular cortex. Interestingly, however, mGlu2 receptor-deficient rats performed better than wild-type rats in the adhesive tape test, in which these rats did not show the laterality preference typically observed after focal ischemia. These findings support the hypothesis that activation of mGlu2 receptors is detrimental in the post-ischemic phase, and support the use of mGlu2 receptor antagonists in the experimental treatment of brain ischemia.","Focal ischemia, mGlu2 receptor, Genetic deletion, Neuroprotection, Neurological score",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0319-6,2017

The two clinical subgroups of Lewy body dementias, namely, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), are differentiated by the chronology of cognitive symptoms relative to parkinsonism. At present, there remains a debate on whether DLB and PDD are separate disease entities, or fall within the same spectrum of Lewy body dementias. In this study, we compared the detergent-soluble proteome via an 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis of pooled lysates from the prefrontal cortex (BA9) of DLB (n = 19) and PDD (n = 21) patients matched a priori for amyloid (total Aβ42) burden, semi-quantitative scores for Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles together with age-matched control (n = 21) subjects. A total of 1914 proteins were confidently identified by iTRAQ (false discovery rate = 0%). None of the proteins showed a significant yet opposite regulation in between DLB and PDD when compared to aged controls in the proteomic data set as well as following immunoblot analysis of the pooled and individual lysates involving all 61 subjects. The postsynaptic protein, synaptopodin (SYNPO) was significantly down-regulated in both DLB and PDD subgroups, suggesting a defective synaptic transmission in the demented patients. In conclusion, the largely similar proteome of DLB and PDD matched for amyloid burden suggests that variations in concomitant AD-related pathology, abnormal post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions, defective intracellular trafficking or misfolding of proteins could play a part in driving the clinically observed differences between these two subgroups of Lewy body dementias.

Many researchers have discovered that there are mechanisms common to both diabetes and AD. AD that results from insulin resistance in the brain is termed “type 3 diabetes”. Melatonin synthesized by the pineal gland is known to contribute to circadian rhythms, insulin resistance, protection of the BBB, and cell survival mechanisms.

Currently, 42 SCA types are known, some of which are caused by CAG repeat expansions, but others are caused by point mutations or deletions. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is caused by missense mutations or deletions in the PRKCG gene, coding for protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ). It is still not well understood how these mutations eventually cause Purkinje cell dysfunction and death. Because PKCγ is a well characterized signaling protein highly expressed in Purkinje cells SCA14 offers the chance to better understand the pathogenesis of Purkinje cell dysfunction and death. Altered biological activity of PKCγ would be the simplest explanation for the disease phenotype. There are indeed indications that the enzymatic activity of mutated PKCγ proteins could be changed. Many mutations found in SCA14 families are located in the regulatory C1B and C1A domain, while a few mutations are also found in the C2 and in the catalytic C3 and C4 domains. For many of these mutations an increased enzymatic activity could be demonstrated in cell-based assays, but it remains unclear whether there is indeed an altered biological activity of the mutated PKCγ proteins within living Purkinje cells. In this study we used the dendritic morphology of developing Purkinje cells to detect increased biological activity of PKCγ after expression of different mutated PKCγ proteins. Our results indicate that two out of three known mutations in the catalytic domain of PKCγ did indeed show increased biological activity. On the other hand, none of the five tested mutations located in the regulatory C1 or the C2 domain showed an increased biological activity. Our findings indicate that SCA14 mutations located in different domains of the PRKCG gene cause SCA14 by different mechanisms and that an increased constitutive activity of PKCγ may be one, but cannot be the only mechanism to cause disease in SCA14.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14, Protein kinase C gamma, Purkinje cell dendritic development",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0313-z,2017

Recent developments in automated operant chamber technology have led to the possibility of universal standard protocols, in addition to increased translational potential, reliability and accuracy. However, the impact of regional and national differences in the supplies of available reinforcers in this system on behavioural performance and inter-laboratory variability is an unknown and at present uncontrolled variable. Therefore, we aimed to identify which constituent(s) of the reward determines reinforcer strength to enable improved standardization of this parameter across laboratories. Male C57BL/6 mice were examined in the touchscreen-based fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules, reinforced with different kinds of milk-based reinforcers to directly compare the incentive values of plain milk (PM, high-calorie: high-fat/low-sugar), strawberry-flavored milk (SM, high-calorie: low-fat/high-sugar), and semi-skimmed low-fat milk (LM, low-calorie: low-fat/low-sugar) on the basis of differences in caloric content, sugar/fat content, and flavor. Use of a higher caloric content reward was effective in increasing operant training acquisition rate. Total trial number completed in FR and breakpoint in PR were higher using the two isocaloric milk products (PM and SM) than the lower caloric LM, with comparable outcomes between PM and SM conditions, suggesting that total caloric content determines reward strength. Analysis of within-session changes in response rate revealed that overall outputs in FR and PR primarily depend on the response rate at the initial phase of a session, which itself was dependent on reinforcer caloric content. Interestingly, the rate of satiation, indicated by decay in response rate within a FR session, was highest when reinforced with SM, suggesting a rapid satiating effect of sugar. The key contribution of reward caloric content to operant performance was confirmed in a multi-laboratory study using the touchscreen 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) reinforced by two isocaloric milk-based liquid rewards with different countries of origin, which yielded consistent performance parameters across sites. Our results indicate that milk-based liquid reinforcer standardization can be facilitated by matching caloric content across laboratories despite regional or national differences in other non-caloric aspects of the reinforcers.","Reinforcer, Operant behavior, Calories, Touchscreen chamber, Standardization",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0312-0,2017

MGF induces muscle cell proliferation in response to muscle stress and injury. In control mice we found endogenous expression of MGF in neurogenic areas of the brain and these levels declined with age. To better understand the role of MGF in the brain, we used transgenic mice that constitutively overexpressed MGF from birth. MGF overexpression significantly increased the number of BrdU+ proliferative cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVG). Although MGF overexpression increased the overall rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis at the proliferation stage it did not alter the distribution of neurons at post-mitotic maturation stages. We then used the lac-operon system to conditionally overexpress MGF in the mouse brain beginning at 1, 3 and 12 months with histological and behavioral observation at 24 months of age. With conditional overexpression there was an increase of BrdU+ proliferating cells and BrdU+ differentiated mature neurons in the olfactory bulbs at 24 months when overexpression was induced from 1 and 3 months of age but not when started at 12 months. This was associated with preserved olfactory function. In vitro, MGF increased the size and number of neurospheres harvested from SVZ-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). These findings indicate that MGF overexpression increases the number of neural progenitor cells and promotes neurogenesis but does not alter the distribution of adult newborn neurons at post-mitotic stages. Maintaining youthful levels of MGF may be important in reversing age-related neuronal loss and brain dysfunction.","Mechano growth factor (MGF), Neural stem cells, Neurogenesis, Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), Neuroprotection, Aging",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0304-0,2017

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hemin functions as a TLR2 endogenous agonist, causing proinflammatory astrocyte activation and secondary brain damage after ICH. Hemin administration to the mouse brain striatum induced ICH injury and neurological deficits, however, the brain injury volume and neurological deficits due to hemin injection were significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out (KO) mice. Hemin administration induced neutrophil infiltration and upregulated neutrophil-attracting chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine expression in wild-type (WT) mice; these effects were ameliorated in TLR2 KO mice. Likewise, ICH-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage was also decreased in TLR2 KO mice. This effect was most likely due to reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) activity in the TLR2 KO mice compared to WT mice. In primary astrocytes, hemin directly induced MMP9 activity as well as proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in a TLR2-dependent manner. Finally, hemin-induced MMP9 activity and proinflammatory gene expression were almost completely blocked by TLR2-neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, our data propose that heme released to the brain parenchyma after ICH injury activates TLR2 in astrocytes and induces inflammatory gene expression and BBB damage, which contribute to secondary brain damage after ICH.","Secondary Brain Damage, Heme Molecule, Induced MMP9 Activity, Hemin Administration, TLR2 Neutralizing Antibody",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0305-z,2017

On the one hand, in order to safeguard the microenvironment microglia can be rapidly activated by contact with microbial products or cell debris, thereby exerting the functions of innate immunity via phagocytosis and secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Conversely, microglia can also assist in brain development, synaptic plasticity and neural repair through the production of neurotrophic factors and clearance of myelin debris. It is now well accepted that the dysfunction of microglia and microglia-induced neuroinflammation are implicated in the occurrence and progression of many neurological diseases. Although the past decade has witnessed major progress in understanding of multi-tasking microglia, what remains largely enigmatic is the relative importance of microglia at different disease stages and how microglia should be targeted for optimal therapeutic efficacy. Notably, microglia depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological therapies can be viewed as effective tools to stimulate new microglia to repopulate the central nervous system. Microglia depletion and subsequent repopulation at defined stages in various experimental animal model disorders allow us to extend our knowledge of molecular mechanisms, thus holding promise for designing strategies to resolve neuroinflammation and promote recovery.

To provide an adequate plane of surgery, ketamine was co-administered with dexmedetomidine. The apoptotic neurons in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) were quantitated by immunohistochemistry. To explore the effect of neural activity on ketamine-induced apoptosis, the approaches of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) and an environmental enrichment (EE) were performed. Ketamine-induced apoptosis in S1 is most prominent at postnatal days 5 and 7 (P5 – P7), and becomes insignificant by P12. Physiological and ketamine-induced apoptosis follow similar developmental patterns, mostly comprised of layer V pyramidal neurons at P5 and shifting to mostly layer II to IV GABAergic neurons by P9. Changes in neuronal activity induced by the DREADD system bidirectionally regulated the pattern of ketamine-induced apoptosis, with reduced activity inducing increased apoptosis and shifting the lamination pattern to a more immature form. Importantly, rearing mice in an EE significantly reduced the magnitude of ketamine-induced apoptosis and shifted its developmental pattern to a more mature form. Together, these results demonstrate that lamination pattern and cell-type dependent vulnerability to ketamine-induced apoptosis follow the physiological apoptosis pattern and are age- and activity-dependent.

We demonstrate cells treated with patient derived astrocyte conditioned medium demonstrate decreased expression of LC3-II, a key adapter protein required for the selective degradation of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins targeted for degradation. We observed an increased accumulation of p62 in cells treated with patient conditioned medium, with a concomitant increase in the expression of SOD1, a protein associated with the development of ALS. Activation of autophagic mechanisms with Rapamycin reduces the accumulation of p62 puncta in cells treated with patient conditioned medium.

We further report that ApoE isoforms differentially regulate maturation and secretion of BDNF from primary human astrocytes. After 24 h, ApoE3 treated astrocytes secreted 1.75- fold higher pro-BDNF than ApoE2-treated astrocytes, and ApoE2-treated astrocytes secreted 3-fold more mature-BDNF (m-BDNF) than ApoE3-treated astrocytes.

In addition, prion-like encompasses the release of protein aggregates from brain cells and their uptake by neighbouring cells. In mice, the intracerebral injection of Tau inclusions induced the ordered assembly of monomeric Tau, followed by its spreading to distant brain regions. Short fibrils constituted the major species of seed-competent Tau.

Targeting metabotropic glutamate receptors for novel treatments of schizophrenia,"James Maksymetz1,2,, Sean P. Moran2,3 &, P. Jeffrey Conn1,2,3",P. Jeffrey Conn,jeff.conn@vanderbilt.edu,2017-04-26,"Support for the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia has led to increasing focus on restoring proper glutamatergic signaling as an approach for treatment of this devastating disease. The ability of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission has thus attracted considerable attention for the development of novel antipsychotics. Consisting of eight subtypes classified into three groups based on sequence homology, signal transduction, and pharmacology, the mGlu receptors provide a wide range of targets to modulate NMDAR function as well as glutamate release. Recently, allosteric modulators of mGlu receptors have been developed that allow unprecedented selectivity among subtypes, not just groups, facilitating the investigation of the effects of subtype-specific modulation. In preclinical animal models, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the group I mGlu receptor mGlu5 have efficacy across all three symptom domains of schizophrenia (positive, negative, and cognitive). The discovery and development of mGlu5 PAMs that display unique signal bias suggests that efficacy can be retained while avoiding the neurotoxic effects of earlier compounds. Interestingly, mGlu1 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) appear efficacious in positive symptom models of the disease but are still in early preclinical development. While selective group II mGlu receptor (mGlu2/3) agonists have reached clinical trials but were unsuccessful, specific mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptor targeting still hold great promise. Genetic studies implicated mGlu2 in the antipsychotic effects of group II agonists and mGlu2 PAMs have since entered into clinical trials. Additionally, mGlu3 appears to play an important role in cognition, may confer neuroprotective effects, and thus is a promising target to alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Although group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4/6/7/8) have attracted less attention, mGlu4 agonists and PAMs appear to have efficacy across all three symptoms domains in preclinical models.

Modeling environmental risk factors of autism in mice induces IBD-related gut microbial dysbiosis and hyperserotonemia,"Joon Seo Lim1,2,, Mi Young Lim1,2,3,, Yongbin Choi1 &, GwangPyo Ko1,4,5,6",GwangPyo Ko,gko@snu.ac.kr,2017-04-20,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of neurodevelopmental conditions that are sharply increasing in prevalence worldwide. Intriguingly, ASD is often accompanied by an array of systemic aberrations including (1) increased serotonin, (2) various modes of gastrointestinal disorders, and (3) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), albeit the underlying cause for such comorbidities remains uncertain. Also, accumulating number of studies report that the gut microbial composition is significantly altered in children with ASD or patients with IBD. Surprisingly, when we analyzed the gut microbiota of poly I:C and VPA-induced mouse models of ASD, we found a distinct pattern of microbial dysbiosis that highly recapitulated those reported in clinical cases of ASD and IBD. Moreover, we report that such microbial dysbiosis led to notable perturbations in microbial metabolic pathways that are known to negatively affect the host, especially with regards to the pathogenesis of ASD and IBD. Lastly, we found that serum level of serotonin is significantly increased in both poly I:C and VPA mice, and that it correlates with increases of a bacterial genus and a metabolic pathway that are implicated in stimulation of host serotonin production. Our results using animal model identify prenatal environmental risk factors of autism as possible causative agents of IBD-related gut microbial dysbiosis in ASD, and suggest a multifaceted role of gut microbiota in the systemic pathogenesis of ASD and hyperserotonemia.","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder Child, Microbial Taxon",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0292-0,2017

In order to study the central nervous system pathophysiology of the disease, we introduced the French Canadian founder Polr3a mutation c.2015G > A (p.G672E) in mice, generating homozygous knock-in (KI/KI) as well as compound heterozygous mice for one Polr3a KI and one null allele (KI/KO). Both KI/KI and KI/KO mice are viable and are able to reproduce. To establish if they manifest a motor phenotype, WT, KI/KI and KI/KO mice were submitted to a battery of behavioral tests over one year. The KI/KI and KI/KO mice have overall normal balance, muscle strength and general locomotion. Cerebral and cerebellar Luxol Fast Blue staining and measurement of levels of myelin proteins showed no significant differences between the three groups, suggesting that myelination is not overtly impaired in Polr3a KI/KI and KI/KO mice. Finally, expression levels of several Pol III transcripts in the brain showed no statistically significant differences. We conclude that the first transgenic mice with a leukodystrophy-causing Polr3a mutation do not recapitulate the childhood-onset HLD observed in the majority of human patients with POLR3A mutations, and provide essential information to guide selection of Polr3a mutations for developing future mouse models of the disease.","Leukodystrophy, POLR3A, Mouse model, Hypomyelination, RNA Polymerase III, Transfer RNAs",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0294-y,2017

Altered expression levels are associated with many pathological situations such as depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is also crucial for neuron functions, via binding of glucocorticoid hormones (GCs). GR actions largely overlap those of BDNF. It has been proposed that GR could be a regulator of BDNF expression, however the molecular mechanisms involved have not been clearly defined yet. Herein, we analyzed the effect of a GC agonist dexamethasone (DEX) on BDNF expression in mouse neuronal primary cultures and in the newly characterized, mouse hippocampal BZ cell line established by targeted oncogenesis. Mouse Bdnf gene exhibits a complex genomic structure with 8 untranslated exons (I to VIII) splicing onto one common and unique coding exon IX. We found that DEX significantly downregulated total BDNF mRNA expression by around 30%. Expression of the highly expressed exon IV and VI containing transcripts was also reduced by DEX. The GR antagonist RU486 abolished this effect, which is consistent with specific GR-mediated action. Transient transfection assays allowed us to define a short 275 bp region within exon IV promoter responsible for GR-mediated Bdnf repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated GR recruitment onto this fragment, through unidentified transcription factor tethering. Altogether, GR downregulates Bdnf expression through direct binding to Bdnf regulatory sequences. These findings bring new insights into the crosstalk between GR and BDNF signaling pathways both playing a major role in physiology and pathology of the central nervous system.","Glucocorticoid receptor, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Glucocorticoids, Promoters",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0295-x,2017

Peripheral nerve injury, a common cause of neuropathic pain, engages microglia-neuronal signalling which causes disinhibition and facilitated excitation of spinal nociceptive pathways. However, recent literature indicates that the role of microglia in neuropathic pain is sexually dimorphic, and that female pain processing appears to be independent of microglia, depending rather on T cells. Despite this sex difference, pain signalling in the spinal cord converges downstream of microglia, as NMDAR-mediated facilitated excitation in pain transmitting neurons is consistent between males and females. Determining whether pain signalling is sexually dimorphic in humans and, further, addressing the sex bias in pain research will increase the translational relevance of preclinical findings and advance our understanding of chronic pain in women.","Sex differences, Microglia, Neuropathic Pain, T cells, Spinal Cord",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0289-8,2017

Despite a long history of clinical use, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Recently, a novel cellular mechanism of antidepressant action has been proposed: the phenotype of mature brain neurons is transformed to immature-like one by antidepressant drug treatments. We show here that electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), an animal model of ECT, causes profound changes in maturation-related phenotypes of neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult mice. Single ECS immediately reduced expression of mature neuronal markers in almost entire population of dentate granule cells. After ECS treatments, granule cells showed some of physiological properties characteristic of immature granule cells such as higher somatic intrinsic excitability and smaller frequency facilitation at the detate-to-CA3 synapse. The rapid downregulation of maturation markers was suppressed by antagonizing glutamate NMDA receptors, but not by perturbing the serotonergic system. While single ECS caused short-lasting effects, repeated ECS induced stable changes in the maturation-related phenotypes lasting more than 2 weeks along with enhancement of synaptic excitation of granule cells. Augmentation of synaptic inhibition or blockade of NMDA receptors after repeated ECS facilitated regaining the initial mature phenotype, suggesting a role for endogenous neuronal excitation in maintaining the altered maturation-related phenotype probably via NMDA receptor activation. These results suggest that brief neuronal activation by ECS induces “dematuration” of the mature granule cells and that enhanced endogenous excitability is likely to support maintenance of such a demature state. The global increase in neuronal excitability accompanying this process may be relevant to the high efficacy of ECT.","Antidepressant, Electroconvulsive seizure, Hippocampus, Maturation, Granule cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0288-9,2017

Protein and RNA aggregates are a hallmark of ALS pathology and are thought to contribute to ALS by impairing axonal transport. Mutations in several genes known to contribute to ALS result in deposition of their protein products as aggregates; these include TARDBP, C9ORF72, and SOD1. In motor neurons, this can disrupt transport of mitochondria to areas of metabolic need, resulting in damage to cells and can elicit a neuroinflammatory response leading to further neuronal damage. Recently, eight independent human genetics studies have uncovered a link between TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) mutations and ALS. TBK1 belongs to the IKK-kinase family of kinases that are involved in innate immunity signaling pathways; specifically, TBK1 is an inducer of type-1 interferons. TBK1 also has a major role in autophagy and mitophagy, chiefly the phosphorylation of autophagy adaptors. Several other ALS genes are also involved in autophagy, including p62 and OPTN. TBK1 is required for efficient cargo recruitment in autophagy; mutations in TBK1 may result in impaired autophagy and contribute to the accumulation of protein aggregates and ALS pathology. In this review, we focus on the role of TBK1 in autophagy and the contributions of this process to the pathophysiology of ALS.","TBK1, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, Motor neuron disease, Autophagy, Mitophagy, Neuroinflammation, Signaling, Frontotemporal dementia, FTD",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0287-x,2017

In this study, we focused on the unclarified issue of whether the neurotoxicity of Aβ oligomers is a reversible process. Using a primary neuron culture model, we examined whether the neurotoxic effects induced by 2-day treatment with Aβ42 oligomers (Aβ-O) are reversible during a subsequent 2-day withdrawal period. Aβ-O treatment resulted in activation of caspase-3 and eIF2α, effects that were considerably attenuated following Aβ-O removal. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that Aβ-O induced aberrant phosphorylation and caspase-mediated cleavage of tau, both of which were mostly reversed by Aβ-O removal. Furthermore, Aβ-O caused intraneuronal dislocation of β-catenin protein and a reduction in its levels, and these alterations were partially reversed upon Aβ-O withdrawal. The dislocation of β-catenin appeared to reflect synaptic disorganization. These findings indicate that removal of extracellular Aβ-O can fully or partially reverse Aβ-O-induced neurotoxic alterations in our neuron model. Accordingly, we propose that the induction of neurotoxicity by Aβ oligomers is a reversible process, which has important implications for the development of AD therapies.","Alzheimer’s disease, Amyloid β-protein, Neurotoxicity, Oligomer, Primary neuron, Tau, β-catenin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0284-5,2017

It remains unknown how stress regulates the individual amygdala PNs embedded in distinct microcircuits. Here, by using retrograde tracing and electrophysiological recording in in vitro slices, we explored the modulation of acute immobilization stress (AIS) on the basoamygdala (BA) PNs projecting either to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or elsewhere, which we designated as BA-mPFC and non-BA-mPFC PNs respectively. The results showed that in the control mice, both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs/sIPSCs) were comparable between these two subsets of BA PNs. The influences of AIS on sEPSCs and sIPSCs were overall similar between the two neuronal populations. It markedly increased the sEPSCs amplitude but left unaltered their frequency as well as the sIPSCs amplitude and frequency. Despite this, several differences emerged between the effects of AIS on the distribution of sEPSCs/sIPSCs frequency in these two groups of BA PNs. Similar changes were also observed in the sEPSCs/sIPSCs of the two PN populations from mice experiencing forced swimming stress. Their intrinsic excitability, on the other hand, was nearly unaltered following AIS. Our results thus suggest that acute stress recruit both BA-mPFC and non-BA-mPFC PNs mainly through enhancing the glutamatergic transmission they receive.","Amygdala, Acute stress, Intrinsic excitability, Medial prefrontal cortex, Spontaneous postsynaptic current",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0283-6,2017

In particular, we performed gene ontology (GO)-based microarray analysis to elucidate effects of IHT on hippocampal functioning, which were compared with the effects of various previously-reported experimental conditions on that (ref. Gene Expression Omnibus, The National Center for Biotechnology Information). Our microarray analyses revealed that IHT and aging shared alterations in some common GO, which were also observed with kainic acid treatment, Dicer ablation, or moderate glutamate excess. Mapping the altered genes using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes PATHWAY database indicated that IHT and aging affected several pathways including “MAPK signaling pathway”, “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway”, and “glutamatergic synapse”. Consistent with the gene analyses, in vivo analyses revealed that IHT increased phosphorylated tau, reflecting an imbalance of kinases and/or phosphatases, and reduced proteins relevant to glutamatergic synapses. In addition, IHT increased phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase, indicating involvement of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Furthermore, IHT mice demonstrated hyperactivity in Y-maze tests, which was also observed in AD models. We obtained important data or something from the massive amount of microarray data, and confirmed the validity by in vivo analyses: the IHT-induced cognitive impairment may be partially explained by the fact that IHT increases phosphorylated tau via biological processes common to aging.

In this study, we investigated the behavioral phenotypes in adult mice with unilateral transection of the infraorbital nerve (ION) at postnatal day 3 (P3). Although ION-transected mice had normal locomotor activity, motor coordination, olfaction, anxiety-like behaviors, novel object memory, preference for social novelty and sociability, they presented deficits in social memory and spatial memory compared with control mice. In addition, the social memory deficit was associated with reduced oxytocin (OXT) levels in the hypothalamus and could be partially restored by intranasal administration of OXT. Thus, early sensory deprivation does result in behavioral alterations in mice, some of which may be associated with the disruption of oxytocin signaling.","Sensory deprivation, Infraorbital nerve, Social memory, Oxytocin, Spatial memory, Autism",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0278-3,2016
Expression of acid-sensing ion channels and selection of reference genes in mouse and naked mole rat,"Laura-Nadine Schuhmacher1,2 &, Ewan St. John Smith1",Ewan St. John Smith,es336@cam.ac.uk,2016-12-13,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are a family of ion channels comprised of six subunits encoded by four genes and they are expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems. ASICs have been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes: pain, breathing, synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity. Unlike mice and humans, naked mole-rats do not perceive acid as a noxious stimulus, even though their sensory neurons express functional ASICs, likely an adaptation to living in a hypercapnic subterranean environment. Previous studies of ASIC expression in the mammalian nervous system have often not examined all subunits, or have failed to adequately quantify expression between tissues; to date there has been no attempt to determine ASIC expression in the central nervous system of the naked mole-rat. Here we perform a geNorm study to identify reliable housekeeping genes in both mouse and naked mole-rat and then use quantitative real-time PCR to estimate the relative amounts of ASIC transcripts in different tissues of both species. We identify RPL13A (ribosomal protein L13A) and CANX (calnexin), and β-ACTIN and EIF4A (eukaryotic initiation factor 4a) as being the most stably expressed housekeeping genes in mouse and naked mole-rat, respectively. In both species, ASIC3 was most highly expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and ASIC1a, ASIC2b and ASIC3 were more highly expressed across all brain regions compared to the other subunits. We also show that ASIC4, a proton-insensitive subunit of relatively unknown function, was highly expressed in all mouse tissues apart from DRG and hippocampus, but was by contrast the lowliest expressed ASIC in all naked mole-rat tissues.","Acid-sensing ion channel, Gene expression, geNorm, Normalization, Quantitative real-time PCR, Naked mole-rat, Housekeeping gene selection, Central nervous system, Comparative study",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0279-2,2016

Here, we show that MIF increases the expression of Pax6 and Chd7 in NSPCs in vitro. During neural development, the chromatin remodeling factor Chd7 (chromatin helicase-DNA-binding protein 7) is expressed in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon of mouse brain at embryonic day 14.5, as well as in cultured NSPCs. Retroviral overexpression of Pax6 in NSPCs increased Chd7 gene expression. Lentivirally-expressed Chd7 shRNA suppressed cell proliferation and neurosphere formation, and inhibited neurogenesis in vitro, while decreasing gene expression of Hes5 and N-myc. In addition, CHD7 overexpression increased cell proliferation in human embryonic stem cell-derived NSPCs (ES-NSPCs). In Chd7 mutant fetal mouse brains, there were fewer intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) compared to wildtype littermates, indicating that Chd7 contributes to neurogenesis in the early developmental mouse brain. Furthermore, in silico database analysis showed that, among members of the CHD family, CHD7 is highly expressed in human gliomas. Interestingly, high levels of CHD7 gene expression in human glioma initiating cells (GICs) compared to normal astrocytes were revealed and gene silencing of CHD7 decreased GIC proliferation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CHD7 is an important factor in the proliferation and stemness maintenance of NSPCs, and CHD7 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of gliomas.","CHD7, MIF, Neural stem/progenitor cells, Glioma initiating cells",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0275-6,2016

Given the role of the 5-HT2CR in the regulation of ingestive behaviour we investigated the pathophysiological implications of Snord115 deficiency on 5-HT2CR regulated appetite in a genotypically relevant PWS mouse model (PWS-IC). Specifically, we demonstrate that loss of Snord115 expression is associated with increased levels of hypothalamic truncated 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA. The 5-HT2CR promotes appetite suppression via engagement of the central melanocortin system. Pro-opiomelancortin (Pomc) mRNA levels within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) were reduced in PWS-IC mice. We then went on to assess the functional consequences of these molecular changes, demonstrating that PWS-IC mice are unresponsive to an anorectic doses of a 5-HT2CR agonist and that this is associated with attenuated activation of POMC neurons within the ARC. These data provide new insight into the significance of Htr2c pre-mRNA processing to the physiological regulation of appetite and potentially the pathological manifestation of hyperphagia in PWS. Furthermore, these findings have translational relevance for individuals with PWS who may seek to control appetite with another 5-HT2CR agonist, the new obesity treatment lorcaserin.","Snord115, Prader-Willi syndrome, Serotonin 2C recptor, Alternate splicing, Feeding",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0277-4,2016

In addition to its beneficial effects on withdrawal and prevention of relapse, reports of sedation during clinical treatment suggest that arousal networks in the brain may be recruited during Heantos administration. T-type calcium channels are implicated in the generation of sleep rhythms and in this study we examined whether a Heantos-4 extraction modulates T-type calcium channel currents generated by the Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Ca3.3 subtypes. Utilizing whole-cell voltage clamp on exogenously expressed T-type calcium channels we find that Heantos inhibits Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 currents, while selectively potentiating Cav3.2 currents. We further examined the effects of Heantos-4 extract on low-threshold burst-firing in thalamic neurons which contribute to sleep oscillations. Using whole-cell current clamp in acute thalamic brain slices Heantos-4 suppressed rebound burst-firing in ventrobasal thalamocortical neurons, which express primarily Cav3.1 channels. Conversely, Heantos-4 had no significant effect on the burst-firing properties of thalamic reticular neurons, which express a mixed population of Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 channels. Examining Heantos-4 effects following oral administration in a model of absence epilepsy revealed the potential to exacerbate seizure activity. Together, the findings indicate that Heantos-4 has selective effects both on specific T-type calcium channel isoforms and distinct populations of thalamic neurons providing a putative mechanism underlying its effects on sedation and on the thalamocortical network.","Burst firing, Thalamocortical, Thalamus, T-type, Calcium, Epilepsy, Addiction, Heantos-4",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0274-7,2016

Bonnen,pbonnen@bcm.edu,2016-12-01,"ABAT deficiency (OMIM 613163) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by recessive variants in the gene 4-aminobutyric acid transaminase (ABAT), which is responsible for both the catalysis of GABA and maintenance of nucleoside pools in the mitochondria. To date, only a few patients have been reported worldwide. Their clinical presentation has been remarkably consistent with primary features of severe psychomotor retardation, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and infantile-onset refractory epilepsy. We report a new case of ABAT deficiency that marks an important departure from previous clinical findings. The patient presented at age 6 months with global developmental delay, hypotonia, hypersomnolence and mild choreiform movements. At age 18 months, the subject’s clinical presentation was still milder than all previously reported patients and, most notably, did not include seizures. Clinical whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous ABAT missense variants that are rare and predicted damaging, but never before reported in a patient and were reported as variants of unknown significance. To test the potential pathogenicity of the variants identified in this patient we developed a cell-based system to test both functions of the ABAT protein via GABA transaminase enzyme activity and mtDNA copy number assays. This systematic approach was validated using vigabatrin, the irreversible inhibitor of ABAT, and leveraged to test the functionality of all ABAT variants in previously reported patients plus the variants in this new case. This work confirmed the novel variants compromised ABAT function to similar levels as variants in previously characterized cases with more severe clinical presentation, thereby confirming the molecular diagnosis of this patient. Additionally, functional studies conducted in cells from both mild and severe patient fibroblasts showed similar levels of compromise in mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory capacity, ATP production and mtDNA depletion. These results illustrate how cell-based functional studies can aid in the diagnosis of a rare, neurological disorder. Importantly, this patient marks an expansion in the clinical phenotype for ABAT deficiency to a milder presentation that is more commonly seen in pediatric genetics and neurology clinics.","Exome Sequencing, Vigabatrin, Cerebral Spinal Fluid, T98G Cell, GABAT Activity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0273-8,2016

Due to rapidly increasing prevalence in aging society, dementia now confers a major economic, social, and healthcare burden throughout the world, and has therefore been identified as a public health priority by the World Health Organization. Previous studies have established dementia as a ‘proteinopathy’ caused by detrimental changes in brain protein structure and function that promote misfolding, aggregation, and deposition as insoluble amyloid plaques. Despite clear evidence that pathological cognitive decline is associated with degenerative protein modifications (DPMs) arising from spontaneous chemical modifications to amino acid side chains, the molecular mechanisms that promote brain DPMs formation remain poorly understood. However, the technical challenges associated with DPM analysis have recently become tractable due to powerful new proteomic techniques that facilitate detailed analysis of brain tissue damage over time. Recent studies have identified that neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the dysregulation of critical repair enzymes, as well as the misfolding, aggregation and accumulation of modified brain proteins. Future studies will further elucidate the mechanisms underlying dementia pathogenesis via the quantitative profiling of the human brain proteome and associated DPMs in distinct phases and subtypes of disease. This review summarizes recent developments in quantitative proteomic technologies, describes how these techniques have been applied to the study of dementia-linked changes in brain protein structure and function, and briefly outlines how these findings might be translated into novel clinical applications for dementia patients.

However, the molecular component of the local protein synthesis that is required for the initiation of LTF and that is sensitive to emetine is not known. Here, we identify a homolog of ApCPEB responsible for the initiation of LTF.

The ApCPEB4 binds to different target RNAs than does ApCPEB. Knock-down of ApCPEB4 blocked the induction of LTF, whereas overexpression of ApCPEB4 reduces the threshold of the formation of LTF. Thus, our findings suggest that the two different forms of CPEBs play distinct roles in LTF; ApCPEB is required for maintenance of LTF, whereas the ApCPEB4, which lacks a prion-like domain, is required for the initiation of LTF.","Aplysia, Long-term facilitation, CPEB, CPEB4",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0271-x,2016

In the latter case, a fraction of postsynaptic current would be mediated by cation-selective acid-sensing ion channels. Additionally, in both cases, activation of acid-sensing ion channels could modulate synaptic strength by affecting transmitter release and/or sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors. To address potential involvement of acid-sensing ion channels in mediation/modulation of synaptic transmission at hippocampal GABAergic synapses, we studied effects of three structurally different blockers of acid-sensing ion channels on evoked postsynaptic currents using the patch-clamp technique. We found that GABAergic postsynaptic currents, recorded below their reversal potential as inward currents, are suppressed by all the employed blockers of acid-sensing ion channels. These currents were suppressed by ~ 20 % in the presence of a novel blocker 5b (1 μM) and by ~30 % in the presence of either amiloride (25 μM) or diminazene (20 μM). In the same cells the suppression of postsynaptic currents, recorded above their reversal potential as outward currents was statistically insignificant. These results imply that the effects of blockers in our experiments are at least partially postsynaptic. On the other hand, in the case of mediation of a fraction of postsynaptic current by acid-sensing ion channels, an increase of outward currents would be expected under our experimental conditions. Our analysis of a bicuculline-resistant fraction of postsynaptic currents also suggests that effects of the blockers are predominantly modulatory. In this work we present evidence for the first time that acid-sensing ion channels play a functional role at hippocampal GABAergic synapses. The suppressing effect of the blockers of acid-sensing ion channels on GABAergic transmission is due, at least partially, to a postsynaptic but (predominantly) modulatory mechanism. We hypothesize that the modulatory effect is due to functional crosstalk between ASICs and GABAA-receptors recently reported in isolated neurons, however, verification of this hypothesis is necessary.","Protons, Synaptic transmission, Amiloride, Diminazene, GABA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0269-4,2016

We established iPSCs from two LCL clones, which were derived from a healthy donor and a patient carrying PARK2 mutations, by using existing non-integrating episomal protocols. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses showed that the appearance of somatic variations in the genomes of the iPSCs did not vary substantially according to the original cell types (LCLs, T-cells and fibroblasts). Furthermore, LiPSCs could be differentiated into functional neurons by using the direct neurosphere conversion method (dNS method), and they showed several Parkinson’s disease phenotypes that were similar to those of DF-iPSCs.

Here we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which neuronal nuclei structurally adapt to stimuli and discuss how the perturbation of these mechanisms can trigger behavioral malfunction.","Nuclear structure, Chromatin, Epigenetics, Neuronal plasticity, Chromosomal interactions, Neuropsychiatric disorders",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0263-x,2016

ACC-dependent brain functions often rely on ACC processing of various forms of environmental information. To understand the neural basis of ACC functions, previous studies have investigated ACC responses to environmental stimulation, particularly complex sensory stimuli as well as award and aversive stimuli, but this issue remains to be further clarified. Here, by performing whole-cell recording in vivo in anaesthetized adult rats, we examined membrane-potential (MP) responses of layer II/III ACC neurons that were evoked by a brief flash of visual stimulation and pain-related electrical stimulation delivered to hind paws. We found that ~54 and ~81 % ACC neurons exhibited excitatory MP responses, subthreshold or suprathreshold, to the visual stimulus and the electrical stimulus, respectively, with no cell showing inhibitory MP responses. We further found that the visually evoked ACC response could be greatly diminished by local lidocaine infusion in the visual thalamus, and only their temporal patterns but not amplitudes could be changed by large-scale visual cortical lesions. Our in vivo whole-cell recording data characterized in ACC neurons a visually evoked response, which was largely dependent on the visual thalamus but not visual cortex, as well as a noxious electrical stimulus-evoked response. These findings may provide potential mechanisms that are used for ACC functions on the basis of sensory information processing.","Anterior cingulate cortex, Visual stimulus, Visual thalamus, Visual cortex, Pain",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0262-y,2016

We designed this study to clarify the mechanism by which hypothermia helps alleviate acute ischemic stroke. In a middle cerebral artery occlusion model (4 h ischemia without reperfusion), hypothermia effectively reduces mean infarct volume. Hypothermia also prevents neurons in the infarct area from releasing high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the most well-studied damage-associated molecular pattern protein. By preventing its release, hypothermia also prevents the typical middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced increase in serum HMGB1. We also found that both glycyrrhizin-mediated inhibition of HMGB1 and intracerebroventricular neutralizing antibody treatments before middle cerebral artery occlusion onset diminish infarct volume. This suggests a clear neuroprotective effect of HMGB1 inhibition by hypothermia in the brain. We next used real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peri-infarct regions. Although middle cerebral artery occlusion increases the expression of interleukin-1β and tissue necrosis factor-α, this elevation is suppressed by both hypothermia and glycyrrhizin treatment. We show that hypothermia reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and helps salvage peri-infarct regions from the propagation of ischemic injury via HMGB1 blockade. In addition to suggesting a potential mechanism for hypothermia’s therapeutic effects, our results suggest HMGB1 modulation may lengthen the therapeutic window for stroke treatments.","Acute ischemic stroke, High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), Inflammatory cytokines, Penumbra, Hypothermia, Glycyrrhizin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0260-0,2016

We find that either the pharmacological blockade or the genetic ablation of either mGluR5 or CB1 can abrogate both CB1- and mGluR5-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate insult. Interestingly, decreased glutamate release and diminished intracellular Ca2+ do not appear to play a role in CB1 and mGluR5-mediated neuroprotection. Rather, these two receptors work cooperatively to trigger the activation of cell signaling pathways to promote neuronal survival, which involves MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT activation. Interestingly, although mGluR5 activation protects postsynaptic terminals and CB1 the presynaptic site, intact signaling of both receptors is required to effectively promote neuronal survival.

The neural and molecular mechanisms that confine the active phase to either day or night period for the diurnal and the nocturnal mammals are unclear. Here we report that prokineticin 2, previously shown as a circadian clock output molecule, is expressed in the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, and the expression of prokineticin 2 in the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells is oscillatory in a clock-dependent manner. We further show that the prokineticin 2 signaling is required for the activity and arousal suppression by light in the mouse. Between the nocturnal mouse and the diurnal monkey, a signaling receptor for prokineticin 2 is differentially expressed in the retinorecipient suprachiasmatic nucleus and the superior colliculus, brain projection targets of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Blockade with a selective antagonist reveals the respectively inhibitory and stimulatory effect of prokineticin 2 signaling on the arousal levels for the nocturnal mouse and the diurnal monkey. Thus, the mammalian diurnality or nocturnality is likely determined by the differential signaling of prokineticin 2 from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells onto their retinorecipient brain targets.","Circadian clock output, Wakefulness, Sleep, Diurnal, Nocturnal, Prokineticin 2, Oscillation, Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, Suprachiasmatic nucleus, Superior colliculus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0255-x,2016

However, the precise cellular actions of Aβ oligomers and underlying mechanisms in neurons remain to be fully defined. Previous studies have identified mitochondria as a major target of Aβ toxicity contributing to early cognitive decline and memory loss in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, we report that Aβ oligomers acutely elicit distinct effects on the transport and integrity of mitochondria. We found that acute exposure of hippocampal neurons to Aβ oligomers from either synthetic peptides or AD brain homogenates selectively impaired fast transport of mitochondria without affecting the movement of late endosomes and lysosomes. Extended exposure of hipoocampal neurons to Aβ oligomers was found to result in mitochondrial fragmentation. While both mitochondrial effects induced by Aβ oligomers can be abolished by the inhibition of GSK3β, they appear to be independent from each other. Aβ oligomers impaired mitochondrial transport through HDAC6 activation whereas the fragmentation involved the GTPase Drp-1. These results show that Aβ oligomers can acutely disrupt mitochondrial transport and integrity in a time-dependent and pathway-specific manner. These findings thus provide new insights into Aβ-induced mitochondrial defects that may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and AD pathogenesis.","Alzheimer’s disease, Transport, Fragmentation, Hippocampus, HDAC6, Drp-1, GSK3β",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0261-z,2016

In this study, Deaf1-/- mice bred on a mixed C57BL6-BALB/c background were compared to wild-type littermates for 5-HT1A autoreceptor function and behavior in males and females. Despite a sustained increase in 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding levels, the amplitude of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated current in 5-HT neurons was unaltered in Deaf1-/- mice, suggesting compensatory changes in receptor function. Consistent with increased 5-HT1A autoreceptor function in vivo, hypothermia induced by the 5-HT1A agonist DPAT was augmented in early generation male but not female Deaf1-/- mice, but was reduced with succeeding generations. Loss of Deaf1 resulted in a mild anxiety phenotype that was sex-and test-dependent, with no change in depression-like behavior. Male Deaf1 knockout mice displayed anxiety-like behavior in the open field and light-dark tests, while female Deaf1-/- mice showed increased anxiety only in the elevated plus maze. These data show that altered 5-HT1A autoreceptor regulation in male Deaf1-/- mice can be compensated for by generational adaptation of receptor response that may help to normalize behavior.

We have studied the synaptic function and cognition in CD mice using hippocampal slices and a behavioral test sensitive to hippocampal function. We have found that long-term potentiation (LTP) elicited by theta burst stimulation (TBS) was significantly impaired in hippocampal field CA1 of CD animals. This deficit might be associated with the observed alterations in spatial working memory. However, we did not detect changes in presynaptic function, LTP induction mechanisms or AMPA and NMDA receptor function. Reduced levels of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were present in the CA1-CA3 hippocampal region of CD mice, which could account for LTP deficits in these mice. Taken together, these results suggest a defect of CA1 synapses in CD mice to sustain synaptic strength after stimulation.

They are all regulated by mechanisms centered around mitochondrion. Type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) enriched on neuronal plasma membrane. Recent evidences point to the substantial presence of CB1 receptors on neuronal mitochondrial outer membranes (mtCB1) and the activation of mtCB1 influences aerobic respiration via inhibiting mitochondrial cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/complex I pathway. The expression and role of neuronal mtCB1 under TBI are unknown. Using TBI models of cultured neurons, wild type and CB1 knockout mice, we found mtCB1 quickly upregulated after TBI. Activation of mtCB1 promoted metabolic defects accompanied with ATP shortage but protected neurons from apoptosis. Selective activation of plasma membrane CB1 showed no effects on neuronal metabolism and apoptosis. Activation of mtCB1 receptors inhibited mitochondrial cAMP/PKA/complex I and resulted in exacerbated metabolic defects accompanied with a higher ratio of ATP reduction to oxygen consumption decrease as well as neuronal apoptosis. Further research found the remarkable accumulation of protein kinase B (AKT) on neuronal mitochondria following TBI and the activation of mtCB1 upregulated mitochondrial AKT/complex V activity. Upregulation of mitochondrial AKT/complex V activity showed anti-apoptosis effects and alleviated ATP shortage in metabolic defects. Taken together, we have identified mtCB1 quickly upregulate after TBI and a dual role the mtCB1 might play in metabolic defects and neuronal apoptosis initiated by TBI: the inhibition of mitochondrial cAMP/PKA/complex I aggravates metabolic defects, energy insufficiency as well as neuronal apoptosis, but the coactivation of mitochondrial AKT/complex V mitigates energy insufficiency and neuronal apoptosis.","Apoptosis, Mitochondrial type-1 cannabinoid receptor, Metabolic defects, Traumatic brain injury",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0257-8,2016

Defects in astrocyte signaling are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormal neural circuitry such as Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In animal models of FXS, the loss in expression of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP) from astrocytes is associated with delayed dendrite maturation and improper synapse formation; however, the effect of astrocyte-derived factors on the development of neurons is not known. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an important astrocyte-secreted protein that is involved in the regulation of spine development and synaptogenesis. In this study, we found that cultured astrocytes isolated from an Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse model of FXS displayed a significant decrease in TSP-1 protein expression compared to the wildtype (WT) astrocytes. Correspondingly, Fmr1 KO hippocampal neurons exhibited morphological deficits in dendritic spines and alterations in excitatory synapse formation following long-term culture. All spine and synaptic abnormalities were prevented in the presence of either astrocyte-conditioned media or a feeder layer derived from FMRP-expressing astrocytes, or following the application of exogenous TSP-1. Importantly, this work demonstrates the integral role of astrocyte-secreted signals in the establishment of neuronal communication and identifies soluble TSP-1 as a potential therapeutic target for Fragile X syndrome.","Fragile X syndrome, Autism, Astrocytes, Secreted factor, Thrombospondin-1, Synapses, Dendritic spines",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0256-9,2016

We found that both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in the ACC were enhanced after the formation of chronic itch. The paired-pulse ratio in ACC neurons recorded from the DCP group were smaller than those recorded in control group at the 50-ms interval. We also observe a significant increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in the DCP group. Moreover, an increased inward rectification of AMPARs in ACC pyramidal neurons was observed in the DCP group. Interestingly, the calculated ratio of silent synapses was significantly reduced in the DCP group compared with controls.

The research on lissencephaly is further limited because gyration in humans is more evolved than that in model animals such as mice. To overcome these limitations, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the umbilical cord and peripheral blood of two lissencephaly patients with different clinical severities carrying alpha tubulin (TUBA1A) missense mutations (Patient A, p.N329S; Patient B, p.R264C).ResultsNeural progenitor cells were generated from these iPSCs (iPSC-NPCs) using SMAD signaling inhibitors.

DISC1 deficiency resulted in reduced axonal mitochondrial movement, which was partially reversed by concomitant SNPH depletion. In addition, a SNPH deletion mutant lacking the sequence for interaction with DISC1 exhibited an enhanced mitochondrial anchoring effect than wild-type SNPH. Moreover, upon neuronal activation, mitochondrial movement was preserved by DISC1 overexpression, not showing immobilized response of mitochondria.

In addition, the potential role of ASICs in cell differentiation was explored. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction and Western blot revealed the presence of ASIC1 subunits in these cells. Fast drops of extracellular pH activated transient inward currents which were blocked, in a dose dependent manner, by amiloride, a non-selective ASIC blocker, and by Psalmotoxin-1 (PcTX1), a specific inhibitor for homomeric ASIC1a and heteromeric ASIC1a/2b channels. Incubation of cells with PcTX1 significantly reduced the differentiation of NS20Y cells induced by cpt-cAMP, as evidenced by decreased neurite length, dendritic complexity, decreased expression of functional voltage gated Na+ channels. Consistent with ASIC1a inhibition, ASIC1a knockdown with small interference RNA significantly attenuates cpt-cAMP-induced increase of neurite outgrowth.

The initial overproduction of synapses promotes connectivity. Hebbian competition between axons with different activities (the least active are punished) leads to the loss of roughly half of the overproduced elements and this refines connectivity and increases specificity. The neuromuscular junction is innervated by a single axon at the end of the synapse elimination process and, because of its relative simplicity, has long been used as a model for studying the general principles of synapse development. The involvement of the presynaptic muscarinic ACh autoreceptors may allow for the direct competitive interaction between nerve endings through differential activity-dependent acetylcholine release in the synaptic cleft. Then, the most active ending may directly punish the less active ones. Our previous results indicate the existence in the weakest axons on the polyinnervated neonatal NMJ of an ACh release inhibition mechanism based on mAChR coupled to protein kinase C and voltage-dependent calcium channels. We suggest that this mechanism plays a role in the elimination of redundant neonatal synapses.ResultsHere we used confocal microscopy and quantitative morphological analysis to count the number of brightly fluorescent axons per endplate in P7, P9 and P15 transgenic B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1-YFP)16 Jrs/J mice. We investigate the involvement of individual mAChR M1-, M2- and M4-subtypes in the control of axonal elimination after the Levator auris longus muscle had been exposed to agonist and antagonist in vivo. We also analysed the role of adenosine receptor subtypes (A1 and A2A) and the tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor. The data show that postnatal axonal elimination is a regulated multireceptor mechanism that guaranteed the monoinnervation of the neuromuscular synapses.ConclusionThe three receptor sets considered (mAChR, AR and TrkB receptors) intervene in modulating the conditions of the competition between nerve endings, possibly helping to determine the winner or the lossers but, thereafter, the final elimination would occur with some autonomy and independently of postsynaptic maturation.","Motor end-plate, Motor nerve terminal, Cholinergic synapses, Neuromuscular junction",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0248-9,2016

The A1 adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine and antagonist 8-phenyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine were used to study the role of A1 adenosine receptor in ICH-induced secondary brain injury, and antagonists of P38 and Hsp27 were used to study the underlying mechanisms of A1 adenosine receptor actions.ResultsThe protein level of A1 adenosine receptor was significantly increased by ICH, while there was no significant change in protein levels of the other 3 adenosine receptors. In addition, the A1 adenosine receptor expression could be increased by N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine and decreased by 8-phenyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine under ICH conditions. Activation of the A1 adenosine receptor attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the subcortex, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of P38, MAPK, MAPKAP2, and Hsp27. Inhibition of the A1 adenosine receptor resulted in opposite effects. Finally, the neuroprotective effect of the A1 adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine was inhibited by antagonists of P38 and Hsp27.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that activation of the A1 adenosine receptor by N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine could prevent ICH-induced secondary brain injury via the P38-MAPKAP2-Hsp27 pathway.","Adenosine A1 receptor, Intracerebral hemorrhage, P38, MAPKAP2, Hsp27",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0247-x,2016

Transcription factor Zbtb20 has been shown to play a role for hippocampal development but whether it is implicated in mammalian neocortical morphogenesis remains unknown.ResultsHere, we report that during embyogenesis transcription factor Zbtb20 has a dynamic spatio-temporal expression pattern in mitotic cortical progenitors through which it modulates the sequential generation of cortical neuronal layer identities. Zbtb20 knock out mice exhibited enhanced populations of early born L6-L4 neuronal subtypes and a dramatic reduction of the late born L3/L2 neurons. This defect was due to a temporal misbalance in the production of earlier versus later born neurons, leading to a progressive diminishing of the progenitor pool for the generation of L3-L2 neurons. Zbtb20 implements these temporal effects in part by binding to promoter of the orphan nuclear receptor CoupTF1/Nr2f1. In addition to its effects exerted in cortical progenitors, the postmitotic expression of Zbtb20 in L3/L2 neurons starting at birth may contribute to their proper differentiation and migration.ConclusionsOur findings reveal Zbtb20 as a novel temporal regulator for the generation of layer-specific neuronal identities.","Zbtb20, Development, Neocortex, Temporal identity, Transcription factor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0242-2,2016

APP is part of a gene family and its paralogue amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) has both shared as well as distinct expression patterns to APP, including in the retina. Given the impact of APP in the retina we investigated how APLP2 expression affected the retina using APLP2 knockout mice (APLP2-KO).ResultsUsing histology, morphometric analysis with noninvasive imaging technique and electron microscopy, we showed that APLP2-KO retina displayed abnormal formation of the outer synaptic layer, accompanied with greatly impaired photoreceptor ribbon synapses in adults. Moreover, APLP2-KO displayed a significant decease in ON-bipolar, rod bipolar and type 2 OFF-cone bipolar cells (36, 21 and 63 %, respectively). Reduction of the number of bipolar cells was accompanied with disrupted dendrites, reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 at the dendritic tips and alteration of axon terminals in the OFF laminae of the inner plexiform layer. In contrast, the APP-KO photoreceptor ribbon synapses and bipolar cells were intact. The APLP2-KO retina displayed numerous phenotypic similarities with the congenital stationary night blindness, a non-progressive retinal degeneration disease characterized by the loss of night vision. The pathological phenotypes in the APLP2-KO mouse correlated to altered transcription of genes involved in pre- and postsynatic structure/function, including CACNA1F, GRM6, TRMP1 and Gα0, and a normal scotopic a-wave electroretinogram amplitude, markedly reduced scotopic electroretinogram b-wave and modestly reduced photopic cone response. This confirmed the impaired function of the photoreceptor ribbon synapses and retinal bipolar cells, as is also observed in congenital stationary night blindness. Since congenital stationary night blindness present at birth, we extended our analysis to retinal differentiation and showed impaired differentiation of different bipolar cell subtypes and an altered temporal sequence of development from OFF to ON laminae in the inner plexiform layer. This was associated with the altered expression patterns of bipolar cell generation and differentiation factors, including MATH3, CHX10, VSX1 and OTX2.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that APLP2 couples retina development and synaptic genes and present the first evidence that APLP2 expression may be linked to synaptic disease.","Amyloid precursor protein, Amyloid precursor-like protein 2, Synapses, Synaptopathy, Differentiation, Congenital stationary night blindness, Transcription",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0245-z,2016

Astrocytes are the main components of the blood brain barrier (BBB) structure in the brain and participate in regulating BBB integrity and blood flow. The interactions between ECs and astrocytes are essential for BBB integrity in homeostasis and pathological conditions. Here, we studied the effects of human brain microvascular ECs released EMVs on astrocyte functions. Additionally, we investigated the effects of EMVs treated astrocytes on regulating BBB function and cerebral ischemic damage.ResultsEMVs prepared from ECs cultured in normal condition (n-EMVs) or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD-EMVs) condition had diverse effects on astrocytes. The n-EMVs promoted, while the OGD-EMVs inhibited the proliferation of astrocytes via regulating PI3K/Akt pathway. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression (marker of astrocyte activation) was up-regulated by n-EMVs, while down-regulated by OGD-EMVs. Meanwhile, n-EMVs inhibited but OGD-EMVs promoted the apoptosis of astrocytes accompanied by up/down-regulating the expression of Caspase-9 and Bcl-2. In the BBB model of ECs-astrocytes co-culture, the n-EMVs, conversely to OGD-EMVs, decreased the permeability of BBB accompanied with up-regulation of zonula occudens-1(ZO-1) and Claudin-5. In a transient cerebral ischemia mouse model, n-EMVs ameliorated, while OGD-EMVs aggravated, BBB disruption, local cerebral blood flow (CBF) reduction, infarct volume and neurological deficit score.ConclusionsOur data suggest that EMVs diversely modulate astrocyte functions, BBB integrity and CBF, and could serve as a novel therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","Endothelial cells, Microvesicles, Astrocytes, Blood brain barrier, Cerebral blood flow, Gene expression, Cerebral ischemia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0243-1,2016

AP-2δ is restricted to specific regions of the CNS, including a subset of ganglion cells in the retina. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the only output neurons of the retina, are responsible for transmitting the visual signal to the brain.Results
                           AP-2δ knockout results in loss of Brn3c (Pou4f3) expression in AP-2δ -positive RGCs. While AP-2δ-/- mice have morphologically normal retinas at birth, there is a significant reduction in retinal ganglion cell numbers by P21, after eye opening. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that Brn3c is a target of AP-2δ in the retina. Using fluorochrome-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B to trace ganglion cell axons from the eye to the major visual pathways in the brain, we found 87 % and 32 % decreases in ipsilateral and contralateral projections, respectively, to the superior colliculus in AP-2δ-/- mice. In agreement with anatomical data, visually evoked responses recorded from the brain confirmed that retinal outputs to the brain are compromised.ConclusionsAP-2δ is important for the maintenance of ganglion cell numbers in the retina. Loss of AP-2δ alters retinal axonal projections to visual centers of the brain, with ipsilaterial projections to the superior colliculus being the most dramatically affected.

AD is associated with increased oxidative stress, resulting from imbalance in production and clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA and other macromolecules, leading to genome instability and disrupted cellular functions. Base excision repair (BER) plays a major role in repairing oxidative DNA lesions. Here, we compared the expression of BER components APE1, OGG1, PARP1 and Polβ in blood and postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (HC).ResultsBER mRNA levels were correlated to clinical signs and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD. Notably, the expression of BER genes was higher in brain tissue than in blood samples. Polβ mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in the cerebellum than in the other brain regions, more so in AD patients than in HC. Blood mRNA levels of OGG1 was low and PARP1 high in MCI and AD.ConclusionsThese findings reflect the oxidative stress-generating energy-consumption in the brain and the importance of BER in repairing these damage events. The data suggest that alteration in BER gene expression is an event preceding AD. The results link DNA repair in brain and blood to the etiology of AD at the molecular level and can potentially serve in establishing novel biomarkers, particularly in the AD prodromal phase.","Alzheimer’s disease, DNA repair, Base excision repair, DNA glycosylase OGG1, PARP1, APE1, DNA polymerase Polβ, Brain tissue",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0237-z,2016

Performing a paradigm of five sessions of the elevated plus-maze (EPM), we show that the repeated exposure to the EPM induces a long-lasting anxiety causing a gradual increase of anxiolytic activity, which is maintained for at least 21 days.

Persistent pain varies according to its causes, often resulting from local tissue damage or inflammation. Central somatosensory pathway lesions that are not adequately relieved can consequently cause central pain syndrome or central neuropathic pain. Research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie this pathogenesis is important for treating such pain. To date, evidence suggests the involvement of ion channels, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel P2X receptors, in central nervous system pain transmission and persistent modulation upon and following the occurrence of neuropathic pain. Several P2X receptor subtypes, including P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7, have been shown to play diverse roles in the pathogenesis of central pain including the mediation of fast transmission in the peripheral nervous system and modulation of neuronal activity in the central nervous system. This review article highlights the role of the P2X family of ATP receptors in the pathogenesis of central neuropathic pain and pain transmission. We discuss basic research that may be translated to clinical application, suggesting that P2X receptors may be treatment targets for central pain syndrome.","Central pain syndrome, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), P2X receptors",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0240-4,2016

The neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia originates in the prenatal period due to impairments in neuronal developmental processes such as migration and arborization, leading to abnormal brain maturation. Previous studies have identified multiple promising candidate genes that drive functions in neurodevelopment and are associated with schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanisms of how they exert effects on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain largely unknown.ResultsIn our research, we identified growth arrest specific gene 7 (GAS7) as a schizophrenia risk gene in two independent Han Chinese populations using a two-stage association study. Functional experiments were done to further explore the underlying mechanisms of the role of Gas7 in cortical development. In vitro, we discovered that Gas7 contributed to neurite outgrowth through the F-BAR domain. In vivo, overexpression of Gas7 arrested neuronal migration by increasing leading process branching, while suppression of Gas7 could inhibit neuronal migration by lengthening leading processes. Through a series of behavioral tests, we also found that Gas7-deficient mice showed sensorimotor gating deficits.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate GAS7 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Gas7 might participate in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by regulating neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration through its C-terminal F-BAR domain.

Currently, there are very limited therapies available, largely due to the poor understanding of mechanisms underlying alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in humans. Oxidative damage of mitochondria and cellular proteins aggravates the progression of neuroinflammation and neurological disorders initiated by alcohol abuse.ResultsHere we show that ethanol exposure causes neuroinflammation in both human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Ethanol exposure for 24 hours or 7 days does not affect the proliferation of iPS cells and NPCs, but primes an innate immune-like response by activating the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway. This leads to an increase of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3+ (LC3B+) autophagic puncta and impairment of the mitochondrial and lysosomal distribution. In addition, a decrease of mature neurons derived from differentiating NPCs is evident in ethanol pre-exposed compared to control NPCs. Moreover, a second insult of a pro-inflammatory factor in addition to ethanol preexposure enhances innate cellular inflammation in human iPS cells.ConclusionsThis study provides strong evidence that neuronal inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of AUDs through the activation of the inflammasome pathway in human cellular models.","Stem cells, Alcohol use disorders, Neuroinflammation, Human induced pluripotent stem cells, Disease modeling",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0221-7,2016

To date, most gene therapies have used viral-based ubiquitous promoters–however, promoters that restrict expression to target cells will minimize off-target side effects, broaden the palette of deliverable therapeutics, and thereby improve safety and efficacy. Here, we take steps towards filling the need for such promoters by developing a high-throughput pipeline that goes from genome-based bioinformatic design to rapid testing in vivo.MethodsFor much of this work, therapeutically interesting Pleiades MiniPromoters (MiniPs; ~4 kb human DNA regulatory elements), previously tested in knock-in mice, were “cut down” to ~2.5 kb and tested in recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), the virus of choice for gene therapy of the central nervous system. To evaluate our methods, we generated 29 experimental rAAV2/9 viruses carrying 19 different MiniPs, which were injected intravenously into neonatal mice to allow broad unbiased distribution, and characterized in neural tissues by X-gal immunohistochemistry for icre, or immunofluorescent detection of GFP.ResultsThe data showed that 16 of the 19 (84 %) MiniPs recapitulated the expression pattern of their design source. This included expression of: Ple67 in brain raphe nuclei; Ple155 in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and retinal bipolar ON cells; Ple261 in endothelial cells of brain blood vessels; and Ple264 in retinal Müller glia.ConclusionsOverall, the methodology and MiniPs presented here represent important advances for basic and preclinical research, and may enable a paradigm shift in gene therapy.","rAAV Gene therapy, Raphe nuclei, Purkinje cells, Retina, Cornea",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0232-4,2016

Justin Lee, Yang In Kim","cjl@kist.re.kr, yikim@korea.ac.kr",2016-05-06,"BackgroundRecent evidence indicates that histamine, acting on histamine 1 receptor (H1R), resets the circadian clock in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) through the activation of CaV1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptor-mediated internal stores.ResultsIn the current study, we explored the underlying mechanisms with various techniques including Ca2+- and Cl−-imaging and extracellular single-unit recording. Our hypothesis was that histamine causes Cl− efflux through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to elicit membrane depolarization needed for the activation of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels in SCN neurons. We found that histamine elicited Cl− efflux and increased [Ca2+]i in dissociated mouse SCN cells. Both of these events were suppressed by bumetanide [Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter isotype 1 (NKCC1) blocker], CFTRinh-172 (CFTR inhibitor), gallein (Gβγ protein inhibitor) and H89 [protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor]. By itself, H1R activation with 2-pyridylethylamine increased the level of cAMP in the SCN and this regulation was prevented by gallein. Finally, histamine-evoked phase shifts of the circadian neural activity rhythm in the mouse SCN slice were blocked by bumetanide, CFTRinh-172, gallein or H89 and were not observed in NKCC1 or CFTR KO mice.ConclusionsTaken together, these results indicate that histamine recruits the H1R-Gβγ-cAMP/PKA pathway in the SCN neurons to activate CaV1.3 channels through CFTR-mediated Cl− efflux and ultimately to phase-shift the circadian clock. This pathway and NKCC1 may well be potential targets for agents designed to treat problems resulting from the disturbance of the circadian system.","Calcium, CFTR, Chloride, Circadian rhythm, Histamine, NKCC1, Suprachiasmatic nucleus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0227-1,2016

We have previously demonstrated that infiltrated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) engulf myelin debris, forming myelin-laden macrophages (mye-Mϕ). These mye-Mϕ promote disease progression through their pro-inflammatory phenotype, enhanced neurotoxicity, and impaired phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells. We thus hypothesize that the excessive accumulation of mye-Mϕ is the root of secondary injury, and that targeting mye-Mϕ represents an efficient strategy to improve the local inflammatory microenvironment in injured spinal cords and to further motor neuron function recovery. In this study, we administer murine embryonic stem cell conditioned media (ESC-M) as a cell-free stem cell based therapy to treat a mouse model of SCI.ResultsWe showed that BMDMs, but not microglial cells, engulf myelin debris generated at the injury site. Phagocytosis of myelin debris leads to the formation of mye-Mϕ in the injured spinal cord, which are surrounded by activated microglia cells. These mye-Mϕ are pro-inflammatory and lose the normal macrophage phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells. We therefore focus on how to trigger lipid efflux from mye-Mϕ and thus restore their function. Using ESC-M as an immune modulating treatment for inflammatory damage after SCI, we rescued mye-Mϕ function and improved functional locomotor recovery. ESC-M treatment on mye-Mϕ resulted in improved exocytosis of internalized lipids and a normal capacity for apoptotic cell phagocytosis. Furthermore, when ESC-M was administered intraperitoneally after SCI, animals exhibited significant improvements in locomotor recovery. Examination of spinal cords of the ESC-M treated mice revealed similar improvements in macrophage function as well as a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory environment at the lesion and parenchyma.ConclusionsThe embryonic stem cell conditioned media can be used as an effective treatment for SCI to resolve inflammation and improve functional recovery while circumventing the complications involved in whole cell transplantation.","Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Myelin, Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs), Microglia, Inflammation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0233-3,2016

Maturation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is a complex and inefficient process requiring assistance from multiple cellular factors including RIC-3, a functionally conserved endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-specific chaperone. In mammals and in Drosophila melanogaster RIC-3 is alternatively spliced to produce multiple isoforms.ResultsWe used electrophysiological analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes, in situ hybridization, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays to investigate regulation of RIC-3’s expression and splicing and its effects on the expression of three major neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We found that RIC-3 expression level and splicing affect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor functional expression and that two conserved RIC-3 isoforms express in the brain differentially. Moreover, in immune cells RIC-3 expression and splicing are regulated by inflammatory signals.ConclusionsRegulation of expression level and splicing of RIC-3 in brain and in immune cells following inflammation enables regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor functional expression. Specifically, in immune cells such regulation via effects on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, known to function in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, may have a role in neuroinflammatory diseases.","Acetylcholine, RIC-3, Protein maturation, Alternative splicing, Disordered protein, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), Inflammation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0231-5,2016

Cell-autonomous molecules have been extensively studied in dendrite morphogenesis; however, the regulatory mechanisms of environmental factors in dendrite growth remain to be elucidated.ResultsBy evaluating the angle between two primary dendrites (PD-Angle), we found that the directional growth of the primary dendrites of a Drosophila periphery sensory neuron ddaE is regulated by the morphogen molecule Wingless (Wg). During the early stage of dendrite growth, Wg is expressed in a group of epithelial cells posteriorly adjacent to ddaE. When Wg expression is reduced or shifted anteriorly, the PD-Angle is markedly decreased. Furthermore, Wg receptor Frizzled functions together with Flamingo and Dishevelled in transducing the Wg signal into ddaE neuron, and the downstream signal is mediated by non-canonical Wnt pathway through Rac1.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we reveal that epithelia-derived Wg plays a repulsive role in regulating the directional growth of dendrites through the non-canonical Wnt pathway.

Hence, we tried to determine the role of PAK1 and molecular mechanisms of neuronal death involved in neurodegeneration.ResultsExpression of a dominant-negative form of PAK1 (PAK1H83,86L, K299R, PAK1-DN) decreased the cell viability and increased cell death induced by oxidative stress. Indeed, oxidative stress decreased the phosphorylation of PAK1 in neuroblastoma cells, cultured dopamine (DA) neurons, or rat midbrains. PAK1-DN reduced the level of Bcl-2 protein, through an ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism. The level of Bcl-2 may be regulated by PAK1-ERK signaling and/or PAK1, directly. Conversely, expression of an active form of PAK1 (PAK1T423E, PAK1-CA) could recover both loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and behavioral defects in a 6-OHDA-induced hemiparkinsonian rat model.ConclusionsOur data suggest that the oxidative stress-induced down-regulation of PAK1 activity could be involved in the loss of mesencephalic DA neurons through modulation of neuronal death, suggesting a novel role of PAK1 as a molecular determinant and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.","PAK1, Bcl-2, Apoptosis, Neurodegeneration, Parkinson’s disease",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0230-6,2016

Adult neurogenesis is controlled at multiple levels, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death (PCD). Among these, PCD is the last and most prominent process for regulating the final number of mature neurons integrated into neural circuits. PCD can be classified into apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagic cell death and emerging evidence suggests that all three may be important modes of cell death in neural stem/progenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate PCD and thereby impact the intricate balance between self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation during adult neurogenesis are not well understood. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the extent, mechanism, and biological significance of PCD for the control of adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain. The role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the regulation of PCD at the molecular and systems levels is also discussed. Adult neurogenesis is a dynamic process, and the signals for differentiation, proliferation, and death of neural progenitor/stem cells are closely interrelated.

Characterization of these macrophages revealed expression of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage markers. In the macrophage-depleted mice, ICH-induced brain lesion volume was larger and neurological deficits were more severe compared to those of control mice, indicating a protective role of these macrophages in ICH.

Parkin is a HECT/RING hybrid ligase that physically receives ubiquitin on its catalytic centre and passes ubiquitin onto its substrates, whereas FBXO7 is an adaptor protein in Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) SCFFBXO7 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to recognize substrates and mediate substrates ubiquitination by SCFFBXO7 E3 ligase. Here, we discuss the overlapping pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical features linking Parkin and FBXO7 with autosomal recessive PD. Both proteins play an important role in neuroprotective mitophagy to clear away impaired mitochondria. Parkin can be recruited to impaired mitochondria whereas cellular stress can promote FBXO7 mitochondrial translocation. PD-linked FBXO7 can recruit Parkin into damaged mitochondria and facilitate its aggregation. WT FBXO7, but not PD-linked FBXO7 mutants can rescue DA neuron degeneration in Parkin null Drosophila.

Nutritional status and Leptin deficiency can influence the maturation of neuronal projections and glial patterns, and hypothalamic gliosis occurs in mouse models of obesity. Gnasxl constitutes an alternative transcript of the genomically imprinted Gnas locus and encodes a variant of the signalling protein Gαs, termed XLαs, which is expressed in defined areas of the hypothalamus. Gnasxl-deficient mice show postnatal growth retardation and undernutrition, while surviving adults remain lean and hypermetabolic with increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Effects of this knock-out on the hypothalamic neural network have not yet been investigated.ResultsRNAseq analysis for gene expression changes in hypothalami of Gnasxl-deficient mice indicated Glial fibrillary acid protein (Gfap) expression to be significantly down-regulated in adult samples. Histological analysis confirmed a reduction in Gfap-positive glial cell numbers specifically in the hypothalamus. This reduction was observed in adult tissue samples, whereas no difference was found in hypothalami of postnatal stages, indicating an adaptation in adult Gnasxl-deficient mice to their earlier growth phenotype and hypermetabolism. Especially noticeable was a loss of many Gfap-positive α-tanycytes and their processes, which form part of the ependymal layer that lines the medial and dorsal regions of the 3rd ventricle, while β-tanycytes along the median eminence (ME) and infundibular recesses appeared unaffected. This was accompanied by local reductions in Vimentin and Nestin expression. Hypothalamic RNA levels of glial solute transporters were unchanged, indicating a potential compensatory up-regulation in the remaining astrocytes and tanycytes.Conclusion
                           Gnasxl deficiency does not directly affect glial development in the hypothalamus, since it is expressed in neurons, and Gfap-positive astrocytes and tanycytes appear normal during early postnatal stages. The loss of Gfap-expressing cells in adult hypothalami appears to be a consequence of the postnatal undernutrition, hypoglycaemia and continued hypermetabolism and leanness of Gnasxl-deficient mice, which contrasts with gliosis observed in obese mouse models. Since α-tanycytes also function as adult neural progenitor cells, these findings might indicate further developmental abnormalities in hypothalamic formations of Gnasxl-deficient mice, potentially including neuronal composition and projections.","Gnas, Genomic imprinting, Hypothalamus, Tanycyte, Gfap, Glia, Energy homoeostasis, RNAseq",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0219-1,2016

This pathway under pathological conditions such as NMDA excitotoxicity contributes to metal-catalyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neuronal cell death, and yet its physiological role is not well understood.ResultsWe found that genetic and pharmacological ablation of this neuronal iron pathway in the mice increased glutamatergic transmission. Voltage sensitive dye imaging of hippocampal slices and whole-cell patch clamping of synaptic currents, indicated that the increase in excitability was due to synaptic modification of NMDA receptor activity via modulation of the PKC/Src/NR2A pathway. Moreover, we identified that lysosomal iron serves as a main source for intracellular iron signaling modulating glutamatergic excitability.ConclusionsOur data indicates that intracellular iron is dynamically regulated in the neurons and robustly modulate synaptic excitability under physiological condition.

LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation at 400 Hz (HFS400), and as a reactivation stimulation, we tested a low frequency stimulation at 0.1 Hz (LFS0.1), a theta stimulation at 8 Hz (TS8), or HFS400.

Without reactivation, LTP remained unaffected by protein synthesis inhibition. In addition, the TS8-induced LTP reconsolidation was NMDAR dependent.ConclusionOur results indicate that, as with behavioral LTM, there are boundary conditions for LTP reconsolidation where only a certain range of frequency stimulations as reactivation can destabilize the consolidated LTP.

Neuron viability, synaptic protein expression, mitochondrial morphology, and neurite growth were assayed with immunostaining and confocal microscopy techniques. The effects of anesthetics on the functional development of neural networks were evaluated with whole-cell patch clamp recordings of spontaneous synaptic currents. Our results demonstrate that an acute exposure to sevoflurane and desflurane inhibits the development of neurite processes, impacts the mitochondria, and compromises synaptic proteins - concomitant with a reduction in synaptic function in mature networks. Interestingly, pretreatment of neurons with a mitochondrial division inhibitor (Mdivi-1) not only protected mitochondria integrity but also played a protective role against anesthetic-induced structural and functional neurotoxicity.ConclusionsWe show that Mdivi-1 likely plays a protective role against certain harmful effects of general anesthetics on primary rat neuronal cultures.

Neonatal astrocytes also play multifaceted roles in neuronal circuitry establishment. However, the extent to which neonatal astrocytes differ from their counterparts in the adult brain remains unknown.ResultsBased on ALDH1L1-eGFP expression or sulforhodamine 101 staining, neonatal astrocytes at postnatal day 1–3 can be reliably identified in hippocampal stratum radiatum. They exhibit a more negative resting membrane potential (V
                           M), −85 mV, than mature astrocytes, −80 mV and a variably rectifying whole-cell current profile due to complex expression of voltage-gated outward transient K+ (IKa), delayed rectifying K+ (IKd) and inward K+ (IKin) conductances.

In dual patch recording, electrical coupling was detected in 74 % (14/19 pairs) of neonatal astrocytes with largely variable coupling coefficients. The increasing gap junction coupling progressively masked the rectifying K+ conductances to account for an increasing number of linear voltage-to-current relationship passive astrocytes (PAs). Gap junction inhibition, by 100 μM meclofenamic acid, substantially reduced membrane conductance and converted all the neonatal PAs to variably rectifying astrocytes. The low density expression of leak K+ conductance in neonatal astrocytes corresponded  to a ~50 % less K+ uptake capacity compared to adult astrocytes.ConclusionsNeonatal astrocytes predominantly express a variety of rectifying K+ conductances, form discrete cell-to-cell gap junction coupling and are deficient in K+ homeostatic capacity.","Astrocytes, Hippocampus, K+ conductance, K+ homeostasis, Gap junctions",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0213-7,2016
Regulation of LRRK2 promoter activity and gene expression by Sp1,"Juelu Wang1 &, Weihong Song1",Weihong Song,weihong@mail.ubc.ca,2016-03-22,"BackgroundThe dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal pathway is a prominent neuropathological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mutations in various genes have been linked to familial PD, and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene is one of them. LRRK2 is a large complex protein, belonging to the ROCO family of proteins. Recent studies suggest that the level of LRRK2 protein is one of the contributing factors to PD pathogenesis. However, it remains elusive how LRRK2 is regulated at the transcriptional and translational level.ResultsIn this study, we cloned a 1738 bp 5’-flanking region of the human LRRK2 gene. The transcriptional start site (TSS) was located to 135 bp upstream of translational start site and the fragment −118 to +133 bp had the minimum promoter activity required for transcription. There were two functional Sp1- responsive elements on the human LRRK2 gene promoter revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Sp1 overexpression promoted LRRK2 transcription and translation in the cellular model. On the contrary, application of mithramycin A inhibited LRRK2 transcriptional and translational activities.ConclusionThis is the first study indicating that Sp1 signaling plays an important role in the regulation of human LRRK2 gene expression. It suggests that controlling LRRK2 level by manipulating Sp1 signaling may be beneficial to attenuate PD-related neuropathology.","LRRK2, Sp1, Parkinson’s disease, Gene regulation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0215-5,2016

Improperly regulated neural network synchrony is implicated in pathophysiological conditions such as epilepsy. Despite the awareness of its importance, the molecular signaling underlying the regulation of neural network synchrony, especially after stimulation, remains largely unknown.ResultsIn this study, we show that elevation of neuronal activity by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, Picrotoxin, increases neural network synchrony in primary mouse cortical neuron cultures. The elevation of neuronal activity triggers Mdm2-dependent degradation of the tumor suppressor p53. We show here that blocking the degradation of p53 further enhances Picrotoxin-induced neural network synchrony, while promoting the inhibition of p53 with a p53 inhibitor reduces Picrotoxin-induced neural network synchrony. These data suggest that Mdm2-p53 signaling mediates a feedback mechanism to fine-tune neural network synchrony after activity stimulation. Furthermore, genetically reducing the expression of a direct target gene of p53, Nedd4-2, elevates neural network synchrony basally and occludes the effect of Picrotoxin. Finally, using a kainic acid-induced seizure model in mice, we show that alterations of Mdm2-p53-Nedd4-2 signaling affect seizure susceptibility.ConclusionTogether, our findings elucidate a critical role of Mdm2-p53-Nedd4-2 signaling underlying the regulation of neural network synchrony and seizure susceptibility and reveal potential therapeutic targets for hyperexcitability-associated neurological disorders.","Mdm2, p53, Nedd4-2, Synchrony, Network activity, Multielectrode array, Seizure",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0214-6,2016

Abnormal regulation of this process is associated with developmental and degenerative neuronal disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the PCD of NSCs remain largely unknown. Understanding the mechanisms of PCD in NSCs is crucial for exploring therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.ResultWe have previously reported that adult rat hippocampal neural stem (HCN) cells undergo autophagic cell death (ACD) following insulin withdrawal without apoptotic signs despite their normal apoptotic capabilities. It is unknown how interconnection between ACD and apoptosis is mediated in HCN cells. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is known to be essential for autophagosome maturation in mammalian cells. VCP is abundantly expressed in HCN cells compared to hippocampal tissue and neurons. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of VCP at basal state in the presence of insulin modestly impaired autophagic flux, consistent with its known role in autophagosome maturation. Of note, VCP inaction in insulin-deprived HCN cells significantly decreased ACD and down-regulated autophagy initiation signals with robust induction of apoptosis. Overall autophagy level was also substantially reduced, suggesting the novel roles of VCP at initial step of autophagy.ConclusionTaken together, these data demonstrate that VCP may play an essential role in the initiation of autophagy and mediation of crosstalk between ACD and apoptosis in HCN cells when autophagy level is high upon insulin withdrawal. This is the first report on the role of VCP in regulation of NSC cell death.

This process is controlled by Wnt signaling, which plays a complex role in regulating multiple steps of neurogenesis including maintenance, proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells and the development of newborn neurons. Differential effects of Wnt signaling during progression of neurogenesis could be mediated by cell-type specific expression of Wnt receptors. Here we studied the potential role of Frizzled-1 (FZD1) receptor in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.ResultsIn the adult dentate gyrus, we determined that FZD1 is highly expressed in NSCs, neural progenitors and immature neurons. Accordingly, FZD1 is expressed in cultured adult hippocampal progenitors isolated from mouse brain. To evaluate the role of this receptor in vivo we targeted FZD1 in newborn cells using retroviral-mediated RNA interference. FZD1 knockdown resulted in a marked decrease in the differentiation of newborn cells into neurons and increased the generation of astrocytes, suggesting a regulatory role for the receptor in cell fate commitment. In addition, FZD1 knockdown induced an extended migration of adult-born neurons within the granule cell layer. However, no differences were observed in total dendritic length and dendritic arbor complexity between control and FZD1-deficient newborn neurons.ConclusionsOur results show that FZD1 regulates specific stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, being required for neuronal differentiation and positioning of newborn neurons into the granule cell layer, but not for morphological development of adult-born granule neurons.","Adult neurogenesis, Hippocampus, Neural progenitor cells, Neuronal differentiation, Wnt signaling, Frizzled",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0209-3,2016

Spines can undergo rapid morphological alterations according to synaptic activity. This mechanism is implicated in learning and memory formation as it is ultimately altering the number and distribution of receptors and proteins at the post-synaptic membrane, thereby regulating synaptic input. The Rho-family GTPases play an important role in regulating this spine plasticity by the interaction with cytoskeletal components and several signaling pathways within the spine compartment. Rho-GAP interacting CIP4 homologue2/RICH2 is a Rho-GAP protein regulating small GTPases and was identified as an interaction partner of the scaffolding protein SHANK3 at post-synaptic densities.ResultsHere, we characterize the loss of RICH2 in a novel mouse model. Our results show that RICH2 KO animals display a selective and highly significant fear of novel objects and increased stereotypic behavior as well as impairment of motor learning. We found an increase in multiple spine synapses in the hippocampus and cerebellum along with alterations in receptor composition and actin polymerization. Furthermore, we observed that the loss of RICH2 leads to a disinhibition of synaptic RAC1 in vivo.ConclusionsThe results are in line with the reported role of RAC1 activity being essential for activity-dependent spine enlargement. Since SHANK3 mutations are known to be causative for neuropsychiatric diseases of the Autism Spectrum (ASD), a disintegrated SHANK3/RICH2 complex at synaptic sites might at least in part be responsible for abnormal spine formation and plasticity in ASDs.","Shank3, Small GTPase, Rac1, Dendritic spine, Autism, Neophobia, Spine morphogenesis, Phobia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0206-6,2016
Atypical sensors for direct and rapid neuronal detection of bacterial pathogens,"Ji Yeon Lim1,2,, Seung-In Choi1,2,, Geunyeol Choi1,2 &, Sun Wook Hwang1,2",Sun Wook Hwang,sunhwang@korea.ac.kr,2016-03-09,"Bacterial infection can threaten the normal biological functions of a host, often leading to a disease. Hosts have developed complex immune systems to cope with the danger. Preceding the elimination of pathogens, selective recognition of the non-self invaders is necessary. At the forefront of the body’s defenses are the innate immune cells, which are equipped with particular sensor molecules that can detect common exterior patterns of invading pathogens and their secreting toxins as well as with phagocytic machinery. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines released from these innate immune cells and infected tissues can boost the inflammatory cascade and further recruit adaptive immune cells to maximize the elimination and resolution. The nervous system also seems to interact with this process, mostly known to be affected by the inflammatory mediators through the binding of neuronal receptors, consequently activating neural circuits that tune the local and systemic inflammatory states. Recent research has suggested new contact points: direct interactions of sensory neurons with pathogens. Latest findings demonstrated that the sensory neurons not only share pattern recognition mechanisms with innate immune cells, but also utilize endogenous and exogenous electrogenic components for bacterial pathogen detection, by which the electrical firing prompts faster information flow than what could be achieved when the immune system is solely involved. As a result, rapid pain generation and active accommodation of the immune status occur. Here we introduced the sensory neuron-specific detector molecules for directly responding to bacterial pathogens and their signaling mechanisms. We also discussed extended issues that need to be explored in the future.","Pathogen, Bacteria, Sensory neuron, Pattern recognition receptors, TRPA1, ADAM10, FPR, Pain, Inflammation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0202-x,2016

Wnt3a upregulates brain-derived insulin by increasing NeuroD1 via Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the hypothalamus,"Jaemeun Lee1,, Kyungchan Kim1,, Seong-Woon Yu1 &, Eun-Kyoung Kim1,2",Eun-Kyoung Kim,ekkim@dgist.ac.kr,2016-03-08,"BackgroundInsulin plays diverse roles in the brain. Although insulin produced by pancreatic β-cells that crosses the blood–brain barrier is a major source of brain insulin, recent studies suggest that insulin is also produced locally within the brain. However, the mechanisms underlying the production of brain-derived insulin (BDI) are not yet known.ResultsHere, we examined the effect of Wnt3a on BDI production in a hypothalamic cell line and hypothalamic tissue. In N39 hypothalamic cells, Wnt3a treatment significantly increased the expression of the Ins2 gene, which encodes the insulin isoform predominant in the mouse brain, by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The concentration of insulin was higher in culture medium of Wnt3a-treated cells than in that of untreated cells. Interestingly, neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), a target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and one of transcription factors for insulin, was also induced by Wnt3a treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, the treatment of BIO, a GSK3 inhibitor, also increased the expression of Ins2 and NeuroD1. Knockdown of NeuroD1 by lentiviral shRNAs reduced the basal expression of Ins2 and suppressed Wnt3a-induced Ins2 expression. To confirm the Wnt3a-induced increase in Ins2 expression in vivo, Wnt3a was injected into the hypothalamus of mice. Wnt3a increased the expression of NeuroD1 and Ins2 in the hypothalamus in a manner similar to that observed in vitro.ConclusionTaken together, these results suggest that BDI production is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin/NeuroD1 pathway in the hypothalamus.

Barker1 &, Philippe Séguéla1",Philippe Séguéla,philippe.seguela@mcgill.ca,2016-03-01,"BackgroundSustained, persistent firing (PF) of cortical pyramidal neurons following a short depolarization is a crucial cellular mechanism required for spatial and working memory. Pyramidal neurons in the superficial and deep layers of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (EC) display this property of prolonged firing activity. Here, we focused on the regulation of this activity in EC neurons by mature brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor proBDNF.ResultsUsing patch clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse cortical slices, we observed that BDNF facilitates cholinergic PF in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the medial EC. Inhibition of TrkB with K252a blocks the potentiating effect of BDNF whereas inhibition of p75NTR with function-blocking antibodies does not. By recording spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSC), we find that BDNF acts pre-synaptically via TrkB to increase glutamate release whereas proBDNF acting via p75NTR acts to reduce it. MPEP abolished the facilitating effect of BDNF on PF, demonstrating that the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 plays a critical role in the BDNF effect. In contrast, paired pulse ratio and EPSC measurements indicated that proBDNF, via presynaptic p75NTR, is a negative regulator of glutamate release in the EC.ConclusionsTaken together, our findings demonstrate that the BDNF/TrkB pathway facilitates persistent activity whereas the proBDNF/p75NTR pathway inhibits this mnemonic property of entorhinal pyramidal neurons.","Persistent firing, Neurotrophin, Working memory, Spatial memory, Acetylcholine, mGluR5, p75NTR, TrkB",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0203-9,2016

Importantly, CD38 mutations are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and CD38 knockout (CD38−/−) mice display ASD-like behavioral phenotypes including deficient parental behavior and poor social recognition memory. Although ASD and learning deficits commonly co-occur, the role of CD38 in learning and memory has not been investigated.

However, either long-term potentiation or long-term depression is not impaired in the hippocampus of CD38−/− mice. Our results provide convincing evidence that CD38−/− mice show deficits in various learning and memory tasks including spatial and non-spatial memory tasks.

Sema3F and its receptor neuropilin-2 (Npn-2) are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner in the embryonic mouse brain regions including olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. Sema3F is thought to have physiological functions in the formation of neuronal circuitry and its refinement. However, functional roles of Sema3F in the brain remain to be clarified. Here, we examined behavioral effects of Sema3F deficiency through a comprehensive behavioral test battery in Sema3F knockout (KO) male mice to understand the possible functions of Sema3F in the brain.ResultsMale Sema3F KO and wild-type (WT) control mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests, including neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, social interaction, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, Barnes maze, and fear conditioning tests. In the open field test, Sema3F KO mice traveled shorter distance and spent less time in the center of the field than WT controls during the early testing period. In the light/dark transition test, Sema3F KO mice also exhibited decreased distance traveled, fewer number of transitions, and longer latency to enter the light chamber compared with WT mice. In addition, Sema3F KO mice traveled shorter distance than WT mice in the elevated plus maze test, although there were no differences between genotypes in open arm entries and time spent in open arms. Similarly, Sema3F KO mice showed decreased distance traveled in the social interaction test. Sema3F KO mice displayed reduced immobility in the Porsolt forced swim test whereas there was no difference in immobility between genotypes in the tail suspension test. In the fear conditioning test, Sema3F KO mice exhibited increased freezing behavior when exposed to a conditioning context and an altered context in absence of a conditioned stimulus. In the tests for assessing motor function, pain sensitivity, startle response to an acoustic stimulus, sensorimotor gating, or spatial reference memory, there were no significant behavioral differences between Sema3F KO and WT mice.ConclusionsThese results suggest that Sema3F deficiency induces decreased locomotor activity and possibly abnormal anxiety-related behaviors and also enhances contextual memory and generalized fear in mice. Thus, our findings suggest that Sema3F plays important roles in the development of neuronal circuitry underlying the regulation of some aspects of anxiety and fear responses.","Semaphorin 3 F, Knockout mice, Anxiety, Fear, A behavioral test battery",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0196-4,2016
AMP-activated protein kinase contributes to zinc-induced neuronal death via activation by LKB1 and induction of Bim in mouse cortical cultures,"Jae-Won Eom1,, Jong-Min Lee1,2,, Jae-Young Koh3 &, Yang-Hee Kim1,2",Yang-Hee Kim,yhkim@sejong.ac.kr,2016-02-09,"BackgroundWe reported that zinc neurotoxicity, a key mechanism of ischemic neuronal death, was mediated by poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) over-activation following NAD+/ATP depletion in cortical cultures. Because AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can be activated by ATP depletion, and AMPK plays a key role in excitotoxicity and ischemic neuronal death, we examined whether AMPK could be involved in zinc neurotoxicity in mouse cortical neuronal cultures.ResultsCompound C, an AMPK inhibitor, significantly attenuated zinc-induced neuronal death. Activation of AMPK was detected beginning 2 h after a 10-min exposure of mouse cortical neurons to 300 μM zinc, although a significant change in AMP level was not detected until 4 h after zinc treatment. Thus, AMPK activation might not have been induced by an increase in intracellular AMP in zinc neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) but not Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), was involved in AMPK activation. Although STO-609, a chemical inhibitor of CaMKKβ, significantly attenuated zinc neurotoxicity, zinc-induced AMPK activation was not affected, which suggested that CaMKKβ was not involved in AMPK activation. Knockdown of LKB1 by siRNA significantly reduced zinc neurotoxicity, as well as zinc-induced AMPK activation, which indicated a possible role for LKB1 as an upstream kinase for AMPK activation. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, were noticeably increased by zinc in an AMPK-dependent manner. Finally, caspase-3 activation in zinc-induced neuronal death was mediated by LKB1 and AMPK activation.ConclusionsThe results suggested that AMPK mediated zinc-induced neuronal death via up-regulation of Bim and activation of caspase-3. Rapid activation of AMPK was detected after exposure of cortical neuronal cultures to zinc, which was induced by LKB1 activation but not increased intracellular AMP levels or CaMKKβ activation. Hence, blockade of AMPK in the brain may protect against zinc neurotoxicity, which is likely to occur after acute brain injury.","AMPK, Brain ischemia, LKB1, Bim, Caspase-3, Neuronal death, Zinc",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0194-6,2016

Human brain ECs were used to produce an in vitro H/R-injury model.

A large number of studies comparing young and aged animals have reported differences in various behaviors between age-cohorts, indicating behavioral dysfunctions related to aging. However, relatively little is known about behavioral changes from young adulthood to middle age, and the effect of age on behavior during the early stages of life remains to be understood. In order to investigate age-related changes in the behaviors of mice from young adulthood to middle age, we performed a large-scale analysis of the behavioral data obtained from our behavioral test battery involving 1739 C57BL/6J wild-type mice at 2–12 months of age.ResultsSignificant behavioral differences between age groups (2–3-, 4–5-, 6–7-, and 8–12-month-old groups) were found in all the behavioral tests, including the light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, rotarod, social interaction, prepulse inhibition, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, Barnes maze, and fear conditioning tests, except for the hot plate test. Compared with the 2–3-month-old group, the 4–5- and 6–7-month-old groups exhibited decreased locomotor activity to novel environments, motor function, acoustic startle response, social behavior, and depression-related behavior, increased prepulse inhibition, and deficits in spatial and cued fear memory. For most behaviors, the 8–12-month-old group showed similar but more pronounced changes in most of these behaviors compared with the younger age groups. Older groups exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark transition test whereas those groups showed seemingly decreased anxiety-like behavior measured by the elevated plus maze test.ConclusionsThe large-scale analysis of behavioral data from our battery of behavioral tests indicated age-related changes in a wide range of behaviors from young adulthood to middle age in C57BL/6J mice, though these results might have been influenced by possible confounding factors such as the time of day at testing and prior test experience. Our results also indicate that relatively narrow age differences can produce significant behavioral differences during adulthood in mice. These findings provide an insight into our understanding of the neurobiological processes underlying brain function and behavior that are subject to age-related changes in early to middle life. The findings also indicate that age is one of the critical factors to be carefully considered when designing behavioral tests and interpreting behavioral differences that might be induced by experimental manipulations.","Aging, Behavior, Behavioral test battery, C57BL/6J, Mice",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0191-9,2016
Reduction in parvalbumin expression not loss of the parvalbumin-expressing GABA interneuron subpopulation in genetic parvalbumin and shank mouse models of autism,"Federica Filice1,, Karl Jakob Vörckel2,, Ayse Özge Sungur2,, Markus Wöhr2 &, Beat Schwaller1",Beat Schwaller,Beat.Schwaller@unifr.ch,2016-01-27,"BackgroundA reduction of the number of parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons or a decrease in PV immunoreactivity was reported in several mouse models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This includes Shank mutant mice, with SHANK being one of the most important gene families mutated in human ASD. Similar findings were obtained in heterozygous (PV+/-) mice for the Pvalb gene, which display a robust ASD-like phenotype. Here, we addressed the question whether the observed reduction in PV immunoreactivity was the result of a decrease in PV expression levels and/or loss of the PV-expressing GABA interneuron subpopulation hereafter called “Pvalb neurons”. The two alternatives have important implications as they likely result in opposing effects on the excitation/inhibition balance, with decreased PV expression resulting in enhanced inhibition, but loss of the Pvalb neuron subpopulation in reduced inhibition.MethodsStereology was used to determine the number of Pvalb neurons in ASD-associated brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex and striatum of PV-/-, PV+/-, Shank1-/- and Shank3B-/- mice. As a second marker for the identification of Pvalb neurons, we used Vicia Villosa Agglutinin (VVA), a lectin recognizing the specific extracellular matrix enwrapping Pvalb neurons. PV protein and Pvalb mRNA levels were determined quantitatively by Western blot analyses and qRT-PCR, respectively.ResultsOur analyses of total cell numbers in different brain regions indicated that the observed “reduction of PV+ neurons” was in all cases, i.e., in PV+/-, Shank1-/- and Shank3B-/- mice, due to a reduction in Pvalb mRNA and PV protein, without any indication of neuronal cell decrease/loss of Pvalb neurons evidenced by the unaltered numbers of VVA+ neurons.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the PV system might represent a convergent downstream endpoint for some forms of ASD, with the excitation/inhibition balance shifted towards enhanced inhibition due to the down-regulation of PV being a promising target for future pharmacological interventions. Testing whether approaches aimed at restoring normal PV protein expression levels and/or Pvalb neuron function might reverse ASD-relevant phenotypes in mice appears therefore warranted and may pave the way for novel therapeutic treatment strategies.","Parvalbumin, Shank1, Shank3, Autism, Perineuronal net, Calcium-binding protein, Calcium homeostasis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0192-8,2016

The molecular signaling cascade underlying this event remains obscure.ResultsThrough Ca2+ imaging in acute embryonic cortical slices, we tested if radially migrating cortical excitatory neurons that already bore primitive axons were sensitive to Wnt5a. While Wnt5a only evoked brief Ca2+ transients in immature neurons present in the intermediate zone (IZ), Wnt5a-induced Ca2+ oscillations were sustained in neurons that migrated out to the cortical plate (CP). We wondered whether this early Wnt5a-Ca2+ signaling during neuronal polarization has a morphogenetic consequence. During transition from round to polarized shape, Wnt5a administration to immature cultured cortical neurons specifically promoted axonal, but not dendritic, outgrowth. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the CaMKK-CaMKIα pathway abolished Wnt5a-induced axonal elongation, and rescue of CaMKIα in CaMKIα-knockdown neurons restored Wnt5a-mediated axon outgrowth.ConclusionsThis study suggests that Wnt5a activates Ca2+ signaling during a neuronal morphogenetic time window when axon outgrowth is critically facilitated.

Among them, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored netrin-G subfamily members in the UNC6/netrin family are unique in their differential expression patterns in many neuronal circuits, and differential binding ability to their cognate homologous post-synaptic receptors.ResultsTo gain insight into the roles of these genes in higher brain functions, we performed comprehensive behavioral batteries using netrin-G knockout mice. We found that two netrin-G paralogs that recently diverged in evolution, netrin-G1 and netrin-G2 (gene symbols: Ntng1 and Ntng2, respectively), were responsible for complementary behavioral functions. Netrin-G2, but not netrin-G1, encoded demanding sensorimotor functions. Both paralogs were responsible for complex vertebrate-specific cognitive functions and fine-scale regulation of basic adaptive behaviors conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, such as spatial reference and working memory, attention, impulsivity and anxiety etc. Remarkably, netrin-G1 and netrin-G2 encoded a genetic “division of labor” in behavioral regulation, selectively mediating different tasks or even different details of the same task.

PINK1 expression also increases during neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. Interestingly, expression of GFAP (a marker of astrocytes) was lower in PINK1 knockout (KO) mouse brain lysates compared to wild-type (WT) lysates at postnatal days 1-8, whereas there was little difference in the expression of markers for other brain cell types (e.g., neurons and oligodendrocytes). Further experiments showed that PINK1-KO NSCs were defective in their differentiation to astrocytes, producing fewer GFAP-positive cells compared to WT NSCs. However, the KO and WT NSCs did not differ in their self-renewal capabilities or ability to differentiate to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, during differentiation of KO NSCs there were no defects in mitochondrial function, and there were not changes in signaling molecules such as SMAD1/5/8, STAT3, and HES1 involved in differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes.

"Rasd1, a small G protein with a big role in the hypothalamic response to neuronal activation","Michael P. Greenwood1,, Mingkwan Greenwood1,, Andre S.

                           Rasd1 is a member of the Ras family of monomeric G proteins that was first identified as a dexamethasone inducible gene in the pituitary corticotroph cell line AtT20. Using microarrays we previously identified increased Rasd1 mRNA expression in the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in response to increased plasma osmolality provoked by fluid deprivation and salt loading. RASD1 has been shown to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro resulting in the inhibition of the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that RASD1 may inhibit cAMP stimulated gene expression in the brain.ResultsWe show that Rasd1 is expressed in vasopressin neurons of the PVN and SON, within which mRNA levels are induced by hyperosmotic cues. Dexamethasone treatment of AtT20 cells decreased forskolin stimulation of c-Fos, Nr4a1 and phosphorylated CREB expression, effects that were mimicked by overexpression of Rasd1, and inhibited by knockdown of Rasd1. These effects were dependent upon isoprenylation, as both farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 and CAAX box deletion prevented Rasd1 inhibition of cAMP-induced gene expression. Injection of lentiviral vector into rat SON expressing Rasd1 diminished, whereas CAAX mutant increased, cAMP inducible genes in response to osmotic stress.ConclusionsWe have identified two mechanisms of Rasd1 induction in the hypothalamus, one by elevated glucocorticoids in response to stress, and one in response to increased plasma osmolality resulting from osmotic stress. We propose that the abundance of RASD1 in vasopressin expressing neurons, based on its inhibitory actions on CREB phosphorylation, is an important mechanism for controlling the transcriptional responses to stressors in both the PVN and SON. These effects likely occur through modulation of cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway in the brain.","Glucocorticoid Receptor, Hypertonic Saline, Restraint Stress, cAMP Response Element Binding, Hyperosmotic Stress",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0182-2,2016

To date, 36 dominantly inherited loci have been reported, and 31 causative genes have been identified.ResultsIn this study, we analyzed a Japanese family with autosomal dominant SCA using linkage analysis and exome sequencing, and identified CACNA1G, which encodes the calcium channel CaV3.1, as a new causative gene. The same mutation was also found in another family with SCA. Although most patients exhibited the pure form of cerebellar ataxia, two patients showed prominent resting tremor in addition to ataxia. CaV3.1 is classified as a low-threshold voltage-dependent calcium channel (T-type) and is expressed abundantly in the central nervous system, including the cerebellum. The mutation p.Arg1715His, identified in this study, was found to be located at S4 of repeat IV, the voltage sensor of the CaV3.1. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the membrane potential dependency of the mutant CaV3.1 transfected into HEK293T cells shifted toward a positive potential. We established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts of the patient, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of successful differentiation from the patient-derived iPSCs into Purkinje cells. There was no significant difference in the differentiation status between control- and patient-derived iPSCs.ConclusionsTo date, several channel genes have been reported as causative genes for SCA.

Brain ischemia induces the expression of Gadd45b, which stimulates recovery after stroke and may play a protective role in cerebral ischemia. However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms of how Gadd45b expression regulated and the down-stream targets in brain ischemia. Here, using an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) model, we identified Huwe1/Mule/ARF-BP1, a HECT domain containing ubiquitin ligase, involved in the control of Gadd45b protein level. In this study, we also investigated the role of Huwe1-Gadd45b mediated pathway in BDNF methylation.ResultsWe found that the depletion of Huwe1 by lentivirus shRNA mediated interference significantly increased the expression of Gadd45b and BDNF at 24 h after OGD. Moreover, treatment with Cycloheximide (CHX) inhibited endogenous expression of Gadd45b, and promoted expression of Gadd45b after co-treated with lentivirus shRNA-Huwe1. Inhibition of Gadd45b by lentivirus shRNA decreased the expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) pathway, while inhibition of Huwe1 increased the expression levels of BDNF and p-CREB. Moreover, shRNA-Huwe1 treatment decreased the methylation level of the fifth CpG islands (123 bp apart from BDNF IXa), while shRNA-Gadd45b treatment increased the methylation level of the forth CpG islands (105 bp apart from BDNF IXa).ConclusionsThese findings suggested that Huwe1 involved in the regulation of Gadd45b expression under OGD/R, providing a novel route for neurons following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Suh3 &, Liming Wang1,2",Liming Wang,lmwang83@zju.edu.cn,2015-12-21,"BackgroundFood intake of the adult fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an intermittent feeder, is attributed to several behavioral elements including foraging, feeding initiation and termination, and food ingestion. Despite the development of various feeding assays in fruit flies, how each of these behavioral elements, particularly food ingestion, is regulated remains largely uncharacterized.ResultsTo this end, we have developed a manual feeding (MAFE) assay that specifically measures food ingestion of an individual fly completely independent of the other behavioral elements. This assay reliably recapitulates the effects of known feeding modulators, and offers temporal resolution in the scale of seconds. Using this assay, we find that fruit flies can rapidly assess the nutritional value of sugars within 20–30 s, and increase the ingestion of nutritive sugars after prolonged periods of starvation. Two candidate nutrient sensors, SLC5A11 and Gr43a, are required for discriminating the nutritive sugars, D-glucose and D-fructose, from their non-nutritive enantiomers, respectively. This suggests that differential sensing mechanisms play a key role in determining food nutritional value.ConclusionsTaken together, our MAFE assay offers a platform to specifically examine the regulation of food ingestion with excellent temporal resolution, and identifies a fast-acting neural mechanism that assesses food nutritional value and modulates food intake.","Starvation, Nutritive sugar, Feeding, Drosophila",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0179-x,2015

The present study was designed to investigate whether individual differences in AVP expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and in modulation on the vestibular nucleus (VN) are involved in MS. Systemic application or microinjection of AVP into rat VN and rotatory stimulus were used to induce conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to 0.15 % saccharin sodium solution as a model of MS.ResultsIntra-VN use of SSR149415, an antagonist of V1b receptors (V1bRs), blunted CTA. AVP inhibited Ca2+ influxes through L-type Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptor channels in cultured VN neurones, but antagonised by SSR149415. More AVP and V1bRs were expressed respectively in the PVN and VN after rotatory stimulus, especially in rats susceptible to MS. In the VN, AVP content was low, the AVP mRNA was less expressed, a few AVP-positive fibres were sparsely distributed, and fewer AVP/synaptophysin-positive terminals were identified. Almost no fluoro-ruby-labelled AVP-positive neurones in the PVN were found with retrograde tracing from the VN. SNP analysis of the reported 9 sites of the AVP gene showed significant difference between the groups susceptible and insusceptible to MS at the site rs105235842 in the allele frequencies and genotypes. However, there was not any difference between these two groups in the SNP of the reported 38 sites of V1bR gene.ConclusionsAVP, through its modulatory, possibly humoral action on the VN neurones via the mediation of V1bR, may contribute to the development of motion sickness in rats; AVP gene polymorphisms may contribute to the individual difference in the responsive expression of AVP in the PVN; and higher expressions of AVP in the PVN and V1bRs in the VN may contribute to the development of motion sickness in rats after vestibular stimulation.","Arginine vasopressin (AVP), V1b receptor, Rotatory stimulus, Motion sickness, Conditioned taste aversion, Vestibular nucleus, Paraventricular nucleus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0175-1,2015

Mutations in charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), which is involved in endosomal protein trafficking, have been found in chromosome 3-linked frontotemporal dementia. Despite the number of studies on both CHMP2B and TMEM106B in the endolysosomal pathway, little is known about the relationship between CHMP2B and TMEM106B in the endosomal/autophagy pathway.ResultsThis study found that endogenous TMEM106B was partially sequestered in CHMP2B-positive structures, suggesting its possible involvement in endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-associated pathways. The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms of TMEM106B (T185, S185, or S134N) in the ESCRT-associated pathways were characterized. The T185 and S185 variants were more localized to Rab5-/Rab7-positive endosomes compared with S134N, while all of the variants were more localized to Rab7-positive endosomes compared to Rab5-positive endosomes. T185 was more associated with CHMP2B compared to S185. Autophagic flux was slightly reduced in the T185-expressing cells compared to the control or S185-expressing cells. Moreover, T185 slightly enhanced the accumulation of EGFR, impairments in autophagic flux, and neurotoxicity that were caused by CHMP2BIntron5 compared to S185-expressing cells.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the T185 variant functions as a risk factor in neurodegeneration with endolysosomal defects.

We recently showed that metallothionein 3 (Mt3), a zinc-binding metallothionein that is enriched in the central nervous system, contributes to actin polymerization in astrocytes. Because actin is likely involved in the endocytosis of Aβ, we investigated the possible role of Mt3 in Aβ endocytosis by cortical astrocytes in this study.ResultsTo assess the route of Aβ uptake, we exposed cultured astrocytes to fluorescently labeled Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 together with chloropromazine (CP) or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD), inhibitors of clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis, respectively. CP treatment almost completely blocked Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 endocytosis, whereas exposure to MβCD had no significant effect. Actin disruption with cytochalasin D (CytD) or latrunculin B also completely blocked Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 endocytosis. Because the absence of Mt3 also results in actin disruption, we examined Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 uptake and expression in Mt3
                           −/− astrocytes. Compared with wild-type (WT) cells, Mt3

A similar reduction was observed in CytD-treated WT cells. Finally, actin disruption and Mt3 knockout each increased the overall levels of clathrin and the associated protein phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) in astrocytes.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the absence of Mt3 reduces Aβ uptake in astrocytes through an abnormality in actin polymerization.

Genetic deletion of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which is predominantly expressed in cortex and hippocampus, also causes similar psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, accompanying down-regulated NMDA receptor signaling. However, little is known of such dysfunctions in hippocampus-specific Hbegf cKO mice.ResultsWe successfully developed hippocampus-specific cKO mice by crossbreeding floxed Hbegf and Gng7-Cre knock-in mice, as Gng7 promoter-driven Cre is highly expressed in hippocampal neurons as well as striatal medium spiny neurons. In mice lacking hippocampus Hbegf gene, there was a decreased neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus as well as down-regulation of PSD-95/NMDA-receptor-NR1/NR2B subunits and related NMDA receptor signaling. Psychiatric, social-behavioral and cognitive abnormalities were also observed in hippocampal cKO mice. Interestingly, D-cycloserine and nefiracetam, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of NMDA receptor reversed the apparent reduction in NMDA receptor signaling and most behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, decreased SGZ neurogenesis in hippocampal cKO mice was reversed by nefiracetam.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that PAMs of NMDA receptor have pharmacotherapeutic potentials to reverse down-regulated NMDA receptor signaling, neuro-socio-cognitive abnormalities and decreased neurogenesis in hippocampal cKO mice.","HB-EGF, Neurogenesis, NMDA receptor, Positive allosteric modulator, ADHD, OCD",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0176-0,2015

However, the molecular process by which the extracellular accumulation of Aβ peptides promotes intracellular pathologic changes in tau filaments remains unclear. To elucidate this process, we presumed that astrocytes might trigger neuronal reactions, leading to tau phosphorylation. In this study, we examined AD pathology from the perspective of the astrocyte-neuron interaction.ResultsA cytokine-array analysis revealed that Aβ stimulates astrocytes to release several chemical mediators that are primarily related to inflammation and cell adhesion. Among those mediators, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) was highly upregulated.In AD brains, the expression of IGFBP-3 was found to be increased by western blot analysis, and increased expression of IGFBP-3 was observed in astrocytes via fluorescence microscopy.In addition, we reproduced the increase in IGFBP-3 after treatment with Aβ using human astrocytoma cell lines and found that IGFBP-3 was expressed via calcineurin. In AD brains, the activated forms of calcineurin were found to be increased by western blot analysis, and increased expression of calcineurin was observed in astrocytes via fluorescence microscopy.When Ser9 of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is phosphorylated, GSK-3β is controlled and tau phosphorylation is suppressed. Aβ suppresses the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, leading to tau phosphorylation. In this study, we found that IGF-Ι suppressed tau phosphorylation induced by Aβ, although IGFBP-3 inhibited this property of IGF-Ι. As a result, IGFBP-3 contributed to tau phosphorylation and cell death induced by Aβ.ConclusionsOur study suggested that calcineurin in astrocytes was activated by Aβ, leading to IGFBP-3 release. We further demonstrated that IGFBP-3 produced by astrocytes induced tau phosphorylation in neurons. Our study provides novel insights into the role of astrocytes in the induction of tau phosphorylation and suggests that IGFBP-3 could be an important link between Aβ and tau pathology and an important therapeutic target.","Insulin-like growth factor –Ι, Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, Amyloid–beta, Calcineurin, Astrocyte, Glycogen synthase kinase-3β, Tau",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0174-2,2015

The present study is designed to examine the nPKCε involvement in transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction.ResultsWe use the specific nPKCε translocation inhibitor peptide εV1-2 and electrophysiological experiments to investigate the involvement of this isoform in acetylcholine release. We observed that nPKCε membrane translocation is key to the synaptic potentiation of NMJ, being involved in several conditions that upregulate PKC isoforms coupling to acetylcholine (ACh) release (incubation with high Ca2+, stimulation with phorbol esters and protein kinase A, stimulation with adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, 8-Bromo-, Rp-isomer, sodium salt -Sp-8-BrcAMP-). In all these conditions, preincubation with the nPKCε translocation inhibitor peptide (εV1-2) impairs PKC coupling to acetylcholine release potentiation.

AMPA receptor mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) has been shown to play a critical role in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. No report is available for central changes in the ACC of mice with chronic visceral pain.ResultsIn this study, we used integrative methods to investigate potential central plastic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of a visceral pain mouse model induced by intracolonic injection of zymosan. We found that visceral pain induced an increased expression of AMPA receptors (at the post synapses) in the ACC via an enhanced trafficking of the AMPA receptors to the membrane. Both GluA1 and GluA2/3 subunits were significantly increased. Supporting biochemical changes, excitatory synaptic transmission in the ACC were also significantly enhanced. Microinjection of AMPA receptor inhibitor IEM1460 into the ACC inhibited visceral and spontaneous pain behaviors. Furthermore, we found that the phosphorylation of GluA1 at the Ser845 site was increased, suggesting that GluA1 phosphorylation may contribute to AMPA receptor trafficking. Using genetically knockout mice lacking calcium-calmodulin stimulated adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1), we found that AMPA receptor phosphorylation and its membrane trafficking induced by zymosan injection were completely blocked.ConclusionsOur results provide direct evidence for cortical AMPA receptors to contribute to zymosan-induced visceral and spontaneous pain and inhibition of AC1 activity may help to reduce chronic visceral pain.","AMPA, Anterior cingulate cortex, Irritable bowel syndrome, AC1",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0169-z,2015

The regulated internalization has been characterized as a principal mechanism for removing cell-surface receptors from the plasma membrane, and signaling to downstream targets of receptors. However, so far it is still not known whether the functional properties of remaining (non-internalized) receptor/channels may be regulated by internalization of the same class of receptor/channels. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a principal subtype of glutamate-gated ion channel and plays key roles in neuronal plasticity and memory functions. NMDARs are well-known to undergo two types of regulated internalization – homologous and heterologous, which can be induced by high NMDA/glycine and DHPG, respectively. In the present work, we investigated effects of regulated NMDAR internalization on the activity of residual cell-surface NMDARs and neuronal functions.ResultsIn electrophysiological experiments we discovered that the regulated internalization of NMDARs not only reduced the number of cell surface NMDARs but also caused an inhibition of the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. In biochemical experiments we identified that this functional inhibition of remaining surface NMDARs was mediated by increased serine phosphorylation of surface NMDARs, resulting from the activation of protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Knockdown of PKD1 did not affect NMDAR internalization but prevented the phosphorylation and inhibition of remaining surface NMDARs and NMDAR-mediated synaptic functions.ConclusionThese data demonstrate a novel concept that regulated internalization of cell surface NMDARs not only reduces the number of NMDARs on the cell surface but also causes an inhibition of the activity of remaining surface NMDARs through intracellular signaling pathway(s). Furthermore, modulating the activity of remaining surface receptors may be an effective approach for treating receptor internalization-induced changes in neuronal functions of the CNS.","NMDA receptor internalization, Ligand-gated ion channels, The function of remaining (non-internalized) surface receptors, Protein kinase D1, Phosphorylation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0167-1,2015

The SHANK3 gene encoding core scaffolding proteins at glutamatergic postsynapse is a typical dosage-sensitive gene, both deletions and duplications of which are associated with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, or schizophrenia. However, the regulatory mechanism of SHANK3 expression in neurons itself is poorly understood.ResultsHere we show post-transcriptional regulation of SHANK3 expression by three microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-7, miR-34a, and miR-504. Notably, the expression profiles of these miRNAs were previously shown to be altered in some neuropsychiatric disorders which are also associated with SHANK3 dosage changes. These miRNAs regulated the expression of SHANK3 and other genes encoding actin-related proteins that interact with Shank3, through direct binding sites in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Moreover, overexpression or inhibition of miR-7 and miR-504 affected the dendritic spines of the cultured hippocampal neurons in a Shank3-dependent manner. We further characterized miR-504 as it showed the most significant effect on both SHANK3 expression and dendritic spines among the three miRNAs. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-504, which mimics its reported expression change in postmortem brain tissues of bipolar disorder, decreased endogenous Shank3 protein in cultured hippocampal neurons. We also revealed that miR-504 is expressed in the cortical and hippocampal regions of human and mouse brains.ConclusionsOur study provides new insight into the miRNA-mediated regulation of SHANK3 expression, and its potential implication in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered SHANK3 and miRNA expression profiles.","SHANK3, Post-transcriptional regulation, microRNA, Dendritic spine, Bipolar disorder",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0165-3,2015

Aberrant elevation of BACE1 levels in brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients may involve Aβ. In the present study, we used a neuron culture model system to investigate the effects of Aβ on BACE1 expression as well as the underlying mechanisms.ResultsRat primary cortical neurons were treated with relatively low concentrations (2.5 μM) of Aβ42 oligomers (Aβ-O) or fibrils (Aβ-F) for 2–3 days. Aβ-O induced a significant increase in protein levels of BACE1, while Aβ-F only had a marginal effect. Levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the major α-secretase, ADAM10, remained unaltered upon treatment with both types of Aβ. Aβ-O treatment resulted in activation of eIF2α and caspase 3 in a time-dependent manner, with no changes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, GRP78, indicating that a typical ER stress response is not induced under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, Aβ-O did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression but augmented the levels of exogenous BACE1 expressed via recombinant adenoviruses, indicating regulation of BACE1 protein expression, not at the transcriptional or translational but the post-translational level. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that Aβ-O causes a significant increase in BACE1 immunoreactivity in neurites (both axons and dendrites), but not soma of neurons; this change appears relevant to the mechanism of Aβ-O-induced BACE1 elevation, which may involve impairment of BACE1 trafficking and degradation. In contrast, Aβ-O had no effect on APP immunoreactivity.ConclusionOur results collectively suggest that Aβ oligomers induce BACE1 elevation via a post-translational mechanism involving its altered subcellular distribution in neurons, which possibly triggers a vicious cycle of Aβ generation, thus contributing to the pathogenetic mechanism of AD.","Alzheimer’s disease, Amyloid β-protein, BACE1, Neuron, Oligomer",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0163-5,2015

The inhibition of NF-κB stress-mediated activation with SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, demonstrated a role for MAPK in NF-κB activation by UBQLN2 species.

An increase in plasma osmolality stimulates secretion of AVP to blood circulation and induces AVP synthesis in these nuclei. Although studies on mechanism of AVP transcriptional regulation in hypothalamus proposed that cAMP and glucocorticoids positively and negatively regulate Avp expression, respectively, the molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Recently, we identified CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element binding protein 3 like 1) as a putative transcription factor of Avp transcription in the rat hypothalamus. However the mechanism of how CREB3L1 is regulated in response of hyperosmotic stress in the neurons of hypothalamus has never been reported. This study aims to investigate effect of previously reported regulators (cAMP and glucocorticoid) of Avp transcription on transcription factor CREB3L1 in order to establish a molecular explanation for cAMP and glucocorticoids effect on AVP expression.ResultsThe effect of cAMP and glucocorticoid treatment on Creb3l1 was investigated in both AtT20 cells and hypothalamic organotypic cultures. The expression of Creb3l1 was increased in both mRNA and protein level by treatment with forskolin, which raises intracellular cAMP levels. Activation of cAMP by forskolin also increased Avp promoter activity in AtT20 cells and this effect was blunted by shRNA mediated silencing of Creb3l1. The forskolin induced increase in Creb3l1 expression was diminished by combined treatment with dexamethasone, and, in vivo, intraperitoneal dexamethasone injection blunted the increase in Creb3l1 and Avp expression induced by hyperosmotic stress.ConclusionHere we shows that cAMP and glucocorticoid positively and negatively regulate Creb3l1 expression in the rat hypothalamus, respectively, and regulation of cAMP on AVP expression is mediated through CREB3L1. This data provides the connection between CREB3L1, a newly identified transcription factor of AVP expression, with the previously proposed mechanism of Avp transcription which extends our understanding in transcription regulation of Avp in the hypothalamus.","Transcription, Forskolin, Dexamethasone, Hyperosmotic, Magnocellular neuron, Supraoptic nucleus, Paraventricular nucleus, AtT20, Rat, Organotypic culture",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0159-1,2015

Specific biomarkers could help in early detection and diagnosis, and could also act as indicators of disease progression and therapy effectiveness. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18–25 nucleotides), single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules that play important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression, and are essential for nervous system development. Many of the genes associated with genetic ALS have pathological biological pathways related to RNA metabolism, and their pathogenesis may be affecting the maturing processes of miRNA.ResultsWe compared miRNA from the plasma of sALS patients and healthy controls using two cohorts; a discovery cohort analyzed with microarray (16 sALS patients and ten healthy controls) and a validation cohort confirmed with qPCR (48 sALS patients, 47 healthy controls and 30 disease controls). We measured the total amount of extracted RNA along with a spike-in control that ensured the quality of our quantification. A percentage of the 10–40 nt RNAs extracted from the total RNA showed a significant increase in ALS patients. There was a negative correlation between total RNA concentration and disease duration from onset to end point. Three of the miRNAs were up-regulated and six were down-regulated significantly in the discovery cohort. Since an internal control is required as a sample stability indicator of both the patients and controls in microarray analysis, we selected the miRNA showing the smallest dispersion and equivalency between the two groups’ mean value, and decided to use hsa-miR-4516.

We wondered whether changes in the expression of individual mGlu receptor subtypes selectively occur in the vulnerable CA1 region during the development of ischemic damage, and whether post-ischemic treatment with drugs targeting the selected receptor(s) affords neuroprotection.ResultsWe found that 4-VO caused significantly reduction in the transcript of mGlu2 receptors in the CA1 region at times that preceded the anatomical evidence of neuronal death. Down-regulation of mGlu2 receptors was associated with reduced H3 histone acetylation at the Grm2 promoter. The transcripts of other mGlu receptor subtypes were unchanged in the CA1 region of 4-VO rats. Ischemia did not cause changes in mGlu2 receptor mRNA levels in the resistant CA3 region, which, interestingly, were lower than in the CA1 region. Targeting the mGlu2 receptors with selective pharmacologic ligands had profound effects on ishemic neuronal damage. Post-ischemic oral treatment with the selective mGlu2 receptor NAM (negative allosteric modulator), ADX92639 (30 mg/kg), was highly protective against ischemic neuronal death. In contrast, s.c. administration of the mGlu2 receptor enhancer, LY487379 (30 mg/kg), amplified neuronal damage in the CA1 region and extended the damage to the CA3 region.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the mGlu2 receptor is an important player in mechanisms regulating neuronal vulnerability to ischemic damage, and that mGlu2 receptor NAMs are potential candidates in the experimental treatments of disorders characterized by brain hypoperfusion, such as hypovolemic shock and cardiac arrest.","ADX92639, Epigenetics, Global ischemia, mGlu2 receptors, Neuronal vulnerability",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0158-2,2015

Many studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation facilitates the restoration of the biological function of injured tissue following HIBD via immunomodulation. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which MSCs mediate immunomodulation via the key effectors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).ResultsWe showed that TLR2 expression in the brain of HIBD rats was upregulated following HIBD and that MSC transplantation suppressed the expression of TLR2 and the release of IL-10, thereby alleviating the learning-memory deficits of HIBD rats. Following treatment with the specific TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 to activate TLR2, learning-memory function became further impaired, and the levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and Bax expression and IL-10 release were significantly increased compared with those in HIBD rats that did not receive Pam3CSK4. In vitro, we found that MSC co-culture downregulated TLR2/NFκB signaling and repressed Bax expression and IL-10 secretion in oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-injured adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Furthermore, NFκB and Bax expression and IL-10 release were enhanced following Pam3CSK4 treatment and were decreased following siTLR2 treatment in OGD-injured PC12 cells in the presence or absence of MSCs.ConclusionsOur data indicate that TLR2 is involved in HIBD and that MSCs decrease apoptosis and improve learning-memory function in HIBD rats by suppressing the TLR2/NFκB signaling pathway via a feedback mechanism that reduces IL-10 release.

Postnatally, granule cells migrate from the external germinal zone radially through the Purkinje cell layer, guided by Bergmann glia fibers, to the internal granular cell layer.Medulloblastomas (MBs) are the most common malignant childhood brain tumor. Many of these tumors develop from precursor cells of the embryonic rhombic lips. Four main groups of MB are recognized. The WNT group of MBs arise primarily from the lower rhombic lip and embryonic brainstem. The SHH group of MBs originate from cerebellar granule cell precursors in the external germinal zone of the embryonic cerebellum. The cellular origins of type 3 and type 4 MBs are not clear.Several ubiquitin ligases are revealed to be significant factors in development of the cerebellum as well as in the initiation and maintenance of MBs. Proteasome dysfunction at a critical stage of development may be a major factor in determining whether progenitor cells which are destined to become granule cells differentiate normally or become MB cells. We propose the hypothesis that proteasomal activity is essential to regulate the critical transition between proliferating granule cells and differentiated granule cells and that proteasome dysfunction may lead to MB. Proteasome dysfunction could also account for various mutations in MBs resulting from deficiencies in DNA checkpoint and repair mechanisms prior to development of MBs.Data showing a role for the ubiquitin ligases β-TrCP, FBW7, Huwe1, and SKP2 in MBs suggest the possibility of a classification of MBs based on the expression (over expression or under expression) of specific ubiquitin ligases which function as oncogenes, tumor suppressors or cell cycle regulators.","Cerebellar granule cells, Sonic hedgehog, WNT1, SCF-β-TrCP, E3 ligase F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7, E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0155-5,2015

Poly ADP-ribosylation mediated by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is known to regulate transcription through histone modification. Recent studies have suggested that PARP-1 positively regulates the formation of long-term memory (LTM); however, the roles of PARP-1 in memory processes, especially processes after retrieval, remain unknown.ResultsHere, we show critical roles for PARP-1 in the consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of contextual fear memory in mice. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 activity in the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on these memory processes. Similarly with previous findings, a micro-infusion of the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide or PJ34 into the dorsal hippocampus, but not mPFC, impaired LTM formation without affecting short-term memory (STM). Importantly, this pharmacological blockade of PARP-1 in the dorsal hippocampus, but not mPFC, also disrupted post-reactivation LTM without affecting post-reactivation STM. Conversely, micro-infusion of the PARP-1 inhibitors into the mPFC, but not dorsal hippocampus, blocked long-term extinction. Additionally, systemic administration of the PARP-1 inhibitor Tiq-A blocked c-fos induction in the hippocampus, which is observed when memory is consolidated or reconsolidated, and also blocked c-fos induction in the mPFC, which is observed when memory is extinguished.ConclusionsOur observations showed that PARP-1 activation is required for the consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of contextual fear memory and suggested that PARP-1 contributes to the new gene expression necessary for these memory processes.","Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, Poly ADP-ribosylation, Hippocampus, Medial prefrontal cortex, Fear conditioning, 3-aminobenzamide, PJ34, Tiq-A, Gene expression, c-fos",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0153-7,2015

We used indirect immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked visualization in cell-based assays on tissue sections from cerebellum (rat and monkey), hippocampus (rat), and immunoblots for the detection of specific or any other autoantibodies.ResultsSerum samples from 51 GTS patients, mean age 35.0 ± 13.1 y, were analyzed. In none of the 51 GTS sera CASPR2 antibodies were detectable. Neither had we found any other specific autoantibodies (LGI1, NMDAR, AMPA1, AMPA/2 or GABAB1/B2). An anti-nuclear pattern of immunoreactivity was observed in 7/51 (14 %) samples. In these patients an immunoblot analysis was used to rule out antibodies directed against well-defined intracellular target antigens. A specific anti-neuronal binding pattern could not be seen in any of the tissue sections.ConclusionsThe results negate that CASPR2 antibodies play a role in the pathogenesis of Tourette syndrome and do not support the assumption that anti-neuronal antibodies are involved.","Tourette syndrome, Antineuronal antibodies, CASPR2, NMDAR, Tic",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0154-6,2015
A video based feedback system for control of an active commutator during behavioral physiology,"Mootaek Roh1,, Thomas J. McHugh2 &, Kyungmin Lee1",Kyungmin Lee,irislkm@knu.ac.kr,2015-10-12,"BackgroundTo investigate the relationship between neural function and behavior it is necessary to record neuronal activity in the brains of freely behaving animals, a technique that typically involves tethering to a data acquisition system. Optimally this approach allows animals to behave without any interference of movement or task performance. Currently many laboratories in the cognitive and behavioral neuroscience fields employ commercial motorized commutator systems using torque sensors to detect tether movement induced by the trajectory behaviors of animals.ResultsIn this study we describe a novel motorized commutator system which is automatically controlled by video tracking. To obtain accurate head direction data two light emitting diodes were used and video image noise was minimized by physical light source manipulation. The system calculates the rotation of the animal across a single trial by processing head direction data and the software, which calibrates the motor rotation angle, subsequently generates voltage pulses to actively untwist the tether. This system successfully provides a tether twist-free environment for animals performing behavioral tasks and simultaneous neural activity recording.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, it is the first to utilize video tracking generated head direction to detect tether twisting and compensate with a motorized commutator system. Our automatic commutator control system promises an affordable and accessible method to improve behavioral neurophysiology experiments, particularly in mice.","In vivo, Mice, Motorized commutator, Video tracking",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0152-8,2015

Newton,Samuel.Sathyanesan@usd.edu,2015-10-06,"BackgroundNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases and manage pain, fever and inflammation in several conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Although they predominantly function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, important COX-independent actions also occur. These actions could be responsible for the adverse side effects associated with chronic and/or high dose usage of this popular drug class.ResultsWe examined gene regulation in the hippocampus after peripheral administration of indomethacin by employing a microarray approach. Secondary confirmation and the brain expression pattern of regulated genes was examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Transglutaminase 2, serum glucocorticoid inducible kinase, Inhibitor of NF-kappa B and vascular endothelial growth factor were among genes that were prominently upregulated, while G-protein coupled receptor 56 and neuropeptide Y were among genes that were downregulated by indomethacin. Co-localization studies using blood vessel markers revealed that transglutaminase 2 was induced specifically in brain vasculature.ConclusionsThe data demonstrate that COX-inhibitors can differentially regulate gene transcription in multiple, functionally distinctly cell types in the brain.

Up-regulation of LIMK2 expression induces neuronal necrosis by impairment of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission. However, we could not elucidate the upstream effecter for LIMK2-mediated neuronal death. Thus, we investigated the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in LIMK2-mediated neuronal necrosis, since ET-1 involves neuronal death via various pathways.ResultsFollowing SE, ET-1 concentration and its mRNA were significantly increased in the hippocampus with up-regulation of ETB receptor expression. BQ788 (an ETB receptor antagonist) effectively attenuated SE-induced neuronal damage as well as reduction in LIMK2 mRNA/protein expression. In addition, BQ788 alleviated up-regulation of Rho kinase 1 (ROCK1) expression and impairment of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in CA1 neurons following SE.

To address this, the present study trained rats on an audio-place associative task, whereby the animals were required to associate two different tones with entering two different arms in a Y-shaped maze.

Lombroso4,5 &, Hee Jung Chung1,2",Hee Jung Chung,chunghj@life.illinois.edu,2015-09-22,"BackgroundSustained changes in network activity cause homeostatic synaptic plasticity in part by altering the postsynaptic accumulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxyle-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR), which are primary mediators of excitatory synaptic transmission. A key trafficking modulator of NMDAR and AMPAR is STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP61) that opposes synaptic strengthening through dephosphorylation of NMDAR subunit GluN2B and AMPAR subunit GluA2. However, the role of STEP61 in homeostatic synaptic plasticity is unknown.FindingsWe demonstrate here that prolonged activity blockade leads to synaptic scaling, and a concurrent decrease in STEP61 level and activity in rat dissociated hippocampal cultured neurons. Consistent with STEP61 reduction, prolonged activity blockade enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2B and GluA2 whereas increasing STEP61 activity blocks this regulation and synaptic scaling. Conversely, prolonged activity enhancement increases STEP61 level and activity, and reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation and level of GluN2B as well as GluA2 expression in a STEP61–dependent manner.ConclusionsGiven that STEP61-mediated dephosphorylation of GluN2B and GluA2 leads to their internalization, our results collectively suggest that activity-dependent regulation of STEP61 and its substrates GluN2B and GluA2 may contribute to homeostatic stabilization of excitatory synapses.","STEP, GluN2B, GluA2, Tyrosine phosphorylation, Tetrodotoxin, Bicuculline, Hippocampal neurons, Homeostatic plasticity, Synaptic scaling",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0148-4,2015

In addition, activation of p53 in patient with PD has been reported by several studies. Because phosphorylation of p53 is critical for regulating its activity and LRRK2 is a kinase, we tested whether p53 is phosphorylated by LRRK2.ResultsLRRK2 phosphorylates threonine (Thr) at TXR sites in an in vitro kinase assay, and the T304 and T377 were identified as putative phosphorylated residues. An increase of phospho-Thr in the p53 TXR motif was confirmed in the cells overexpressing G2019S, and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of a G2019S carrier. Interactions between LRRK2 and p53 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of lysates of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. LRRK2 mediated p53 phosphorylation translocalizes p53 predominantly to nucleus and increases p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in SH-SY5Y cells based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay results. The luciferase assay using the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter-reporter also confirmed that LRRK2 kinase activity increases p21 expression. Exogenous expression of G2019S and the phosphomimetic p53 T304/377D mutants increased expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and cleaved PARP, and cytotoxicity in the same cells.

We previously identified a niche mechanism regulating proliferation and neuronal development in the adult mouse dentate gyrus resulting from the activity-regulated expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sfrp3) by mature neurons, which suppresses activation of radial glia-like neural stem cells (RGLs) through inhibition of Wingless/INT (WNT) protein signaling.ResultsHere, we show that activation rates within the quiescent RGL population decrease gradually along the septo-temporal axis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus, as defined by MCM2 expression in RGLs. Using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR, we identified an inverse septal-to-temporal increase in the expression of sfrp3 that emerges during postnatal development. Elimination of sfrp3 and its molecular gradient leads to increased RGL activation, preferentially in the temporal region of the adult dentate gyrus.ConclusionsOur study identifies a niche mechanism that contributes to the graded distribution of neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus and has important implications for understanding functional differences associated with adult hippocampal neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis.","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, Molecular gradient, neural stem cells, Septo-temporal axis, Wnt, niche",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0143-9,2015

We previously showed downregulation in IIS gene expression in astrocytes with AD-neuropathology progression, but IIS in astrocytes remains poorly understood. We therefore examined the IIS pathway in human astrocytes and developed models to reduce IIS at the level of the insulin or the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R).ResultsWe determined IIS was present and functional in human astrocytes by immunoblotting and showed astrocytes express the insulin receptor (IR)-B isoform of Ir. Immunocytochemistry and cell fractionation followed by western blotting revealed the phosphorylation status of insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) affects its subcellular localisation. To validate IRS1 expression patterns observed in culture, expression of key pathway components was assessed on post-mortem AD and control tissue using immunohistochemistry. Insulin signalling was impaired in cultured astrocytes by treatment with insulin + fructose and resulted in decreased IR and Akt phosphorylation (pAkt S473). A monoclonal antibody against IGF1R (MAB391) induced degradation of IGF1R receptor with an associated decrease in downstream pAkt S473. Neither treatment affected cell growth or viability as measured by MTT and Cyquant® assays or GFAP immunoreactivity.DiscussionIIS is functional in astrocytes. IR-B is expressed in astrocytes which differs from the pattern in neurons, and may be important in differential susceptibility of astrocytes and neurons to insulin resistance. The variable presence of IRS1 in the nucleus, dependent on phosphorylation pattern, suggests the function of signalling molecules is not confined to cytoplasmic cascades. Down-regulation of IR and IGF1R, achieved by insulin + fructose and monoclonal antibody treatments, results in decreased downstream signalling, though the lack of effect on viability suggests that astrocytes can compensate for changes in single pathways. Changes in signalling in astrocytes, as well as in neurons, may be important in ageing and neurodegeneration.","Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Insulin Receptor, Human Astrocyte, IGF1 Signalling, Chang Liver Cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0138-6,2015

Although several candidate gene variations have been reported by candidate gene studies or genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to be associated with smoking behavior and the vulnerability to nicotine dependence, such studies have been mostly conducted with subjects with European ancestry. However, genetic factors have rarely been investigated for the Japanese population as GWASs. To elucidate genetic factors involved in nicotine dependence in Japanese, the present study comprehensively explored genetic contributors to nicotine dependence by using whole-genome genotyping arrays with more than 200,000 markers in Japanese subjects.ResultsThe subjects for the GWAS and replication study were 148 and 374 patients, respectively. A two-stage GWAS was conducted using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), Tobacco Dependence Screener (TDS), and number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) as indices of nicotine dependence. For the additional association analyses, patients who underwent major abdominal surgery, patients with methamphetamine dependence/psychosis, and healthy subjects with schizotypal personality trait data were recruited. Autopsy specimens with various diseases were also evaluated. After the study of associations between more than 200,000 marker single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the FTND, TDS, and CPD, the nonsynonymous rs2653349 SNP (located on the gene that encodes orexin [hypocretin] receptor 2) was selected as the most notable SNP associated with FTND, with a p value of 0.0005921 in the two-stage GWAS. This possible association was replicated for the remaining 374 samples. This SNP was also associated with postoperative pain, the initiation of methamphetamine use, schizotypal personality traits, and susceptibility to goiter.ConclusionsAlthough the p value did not reach a conventional genome-wide level of significance in our two-stage GWAS, we obtained significant results in the subsequent analyses that suggest that the rs2653349 SNP (Val308Ile) could be a genetic factor that is related to nicotine dependence and possibly pain, schizotypal personality traits, and goiter in the Japanese population.","Goiter, Nicotine Dependence, Candidate SNPs, Orexin Receptor, TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0142-x,2015

This attenuation promotes the stabilization of cortical circuits, but also limits functional recovery of several brain diseases. The cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are elevated following chronic magnesium treatment. Here, we explored the effect of magnesium treatment on visual plasticity and the potential clinical significance.ResultsVisual plasticity in adult mice was dramatically enhanced following magnesium treatment, which was concurrent with an increase in the expression of NR2 subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Blockade of NR2B activity in both the induction and expression periods of plasticity prevented this reinstatement. However, the plasticity restored via a decrease in cortical inhibition was independent on the activation of NR2B, indicating a different underlying mechanism. The functional excitatory synapses on layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were increased following magnesium supplementation. Moreover, the synaptic and neuronal responses were reminiscent of that within the critical period, and this rejuvenation of adult visual cortex facilitated the recovery of visual functions in amblyopia.ConclusionsCollectively, our data reveal two distinct mechanisms underlying the restoration of visual plasticity in adulthood, and the rejuvenation of adult visual cortex following magnesium treatment provides a new avenue to develop clinical therapies for adult amblyopia, as well as to explore plasticity-based treatment of other brain diseases, such as stroke and aphasia.","Visually Evoke Potential, Ocular Dominance, NR2B Subunit, Magnesium Supplementation, Cortical Inhibition",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0141-y,2015

This delay is more pronounced for the peripheral than the central visual field representation within area 17, particularly between the age of 2 and 4 months [Laskowska-Macios, Cereb Cortex, 2014].ResultsIn this study, we probed for related dynamic changes in the cortical proteome. We introduced age, cortical region and BD as principal variables in a 2-D DIGE screen of area 17. In this way we explored the potential of BD-related protein expression changes between central and peripheral area 17 of 2- and 4-month-old BD (2BD, 4BD) kittens as a valid parameter towards the identification of brain maturation-related molecular processes. Consistent with the maturation delay, distinct developmental protein expression changes observed for normal kittens were postponed by BD, especially in the peripheral region. These BD-induced proteomic changes suggest a negative regulation of neurite outgrowth, synaptic transmission and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thereby implicating these processes in normal experience-induced visual cortex maturation. Verification of the expression of proteins from each of the biological processes via Western analysis disclosed that some of the transient proteomic changes correlate to the distinct behavioral outcome in adult life, depending on timing and duration of the BD period [Neuroscience 2013;255:99-109].ConclusionsTaken together, the plasticity potential to recover from BD, in relation to ensuing restoration of normal visual input, appears to rely on specific protein expression changes and cellular processes induced by the loss of pattern vision in early life.","Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Primary Visual Cortex, Protein Expression Change, Ocular Dominance Plasticity, Cortical Maturation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0137-7,2015

Chronic pain can interfere with specific brain areas involved in glutamate-dependent neuropsychological processes, such as cognition, memory, and decision-making. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to play a critical role in pain-related depression and anxiety, which are frequent co-morbidities of chronic pain. Using an animal model of spared nerve injury (SNI) of the sciatic nerve, we assess bio-molecular modifications in glutamatergic synapses in the mPFC that underlie neuropathic pain-induced plastic changes at 30 days post-surgery. Moreover, we examine the effects of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) administration on pain-related behaviours, as well as the cortical biochemical and morphological changes that occur in SNI animals.ResultsAt 1 month, SNI was associated with mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, as well as depression-like behaviour, cognitive impairments, and obsessive-compulsive activities. Moreover, we observed an overall glutamate synapse modification in the mPFC, characterized by changes in synaptic density proteins and amino acid levels.

Depression-like behaviors have also been described in animal models of persistent or chronic pain. In rodent chronic neuropathic pain models, elevated levels of GluA1 subunits of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been found to inhibit depressive symptoms. However, the effect of reversible post-surgical pain or inflammatory pain on affective behaviors such as depression has not been well characterized in animal models. Neither is it known what time frame is required to elicit AMPA receptor subunit changes in the NAc in various pain conditions.ResultsIn this study, we compared behavioral and biochemical changes in three pain models: the paw incision (PI) model for post-incisional pain, the Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) model for persistent but reversible inflammatory pain, and the spared nerve injury (SNI) model for chronic postoperative neuropathic pain. In all three models, rats developed depressive symptoms that were concurrent with the presentation of sensory allodynia. GluA1 levels at the synapses of the NAc, however, differed in these three models. The level of GluA1 subunits of AMPA-type receptors at NAc synapses was not altered in the PI model. GluA1 levels were elevated in the CFA model after a period (7 d) of persistent pain, leading to the formation of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. As pain symptoms began to resolve, however, GluA1 levels returned to baseline. Meanwhile, in the SNI model, in which pain persisted beyond 14 days, GluA1 levels began to rise after pain became persistent and remained elevated. In addition, we found that blocking GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors in the NAc further decreased the depressive symptoms only in persistent pain models.ConclusionOur study shows that while both short-term and persistent pain can trigger depression-like behaviors, GluA1 upregulation in the NAc likely represents a unique adaptive response to minimize depressive symptoms in persistent pain states.","AMPA Receptor, Spare Nerve Injury, Sucrose Preference, GluA1 Level, Sucrose Preference Test",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0140-z,2015

                     Where \( \overline{F(z)} \) was the mean fluorescence per pixel in the region of the branch in the image (whose coordinate was z) in z-stack (Additional file 1: Figure S1.B).Since we observed that in the range of [−nρ/2, nρ/2], \( \overline{F(z)} \) exhibited well Gaussian distribution (Additional file 1: Figure S1.C), and the normalized distribution curve was the same among different branches (Additional file 1: Figure S1.C), then we knew Σ 
                        \( \overline{F(z)} \) was linearly proportional to \( \overline{F{(z)}_{\max }} \) according to the properties of Gaussian curve, thus:$$ {\left[M{g}^{2+}\right]}_i\propto \frac{4}{\pi {\theta}^2d}\cdot \overline{F{(z)}_{max}} $$
                     And we could further simplify this formula as follows:$$ {\left[M{g}^{2+}\right]}_i\propto \frac{\overline{F{(z)}_{max}}}{d} $$

Meanwhile, the diameter of each branch (d) was measured from the DIC image, then the \( \overline{F{(z)}_{\max }}/d \) was calculated to represent the [Mg2+]i in the branch. The mean value of these 50–100 branches was calculated to represent the level of [Mg2+]i in the AOI. For each coverslip, several AOIs were measured and the mean value of these AOIs was calculated to represent the average level of [Mg2+]i in the coverslip. For each data point, several coverslips were used. For each statistical data point, the mean ± SEM of all coverslips was presented. Specifically for Fig. 2b, each data point represented the [Mg2+]i (MgGrn fluo. a.u.) value in an individual branch.On page 19, the correct Additional file 1: Figure S1 legend is as follows:Additional file 1: Figure S1.

The syndrome is commonly associated to comorbid conditions (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), which considerably aggravate clinical symptoms and complicate diagnosis and treatment. To date, TS molecular bases are unknown and its molecular diagnosis is unfeasible.ResultsDue to their master role within cell networks and pathways both in physiology as in pathology, we sought to determine the transcriptome of circulating miRNAs in TS patients: by TaqMan Low Density Arrays, we profiled the expression in serum of 754 miRNAs in six TS patients and three unaffected controls (NCs) (discovery set). These data were validated by single TaqMan assays on serum from 52 TS patients and 15 NCs (validation set). Network and Gene-ontology analysis were performed by using Cytoscape and Babelomics server. We found that miR-429 is significantly underexpressed in TS patients with respect to NCs. Decreased serum levels of miR-429 allowed us to discriminate TS patients from NCs with 95 % of sensitivity and 42 % of specificity. Intriguingly, computational analysis of the network comprising miR-429 targets demonstrates their involvement in differentiation of midbrain and hindbrain and synaptic transmission.ConclusionsOur data open the way to further molecular characterization of TS and eventual identification of the corresponding genotypes.

Excessive glutamatergic transmission and loss of cholinergic neurons are the major indicators of HAND. Nicotine acts as a cholinergic channel modulator, and its cognitive-enhancing effect in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders has been documented. However, it is unclear whether nicotine has any positive effect on memory and synaptic plasticity formation in HAND.MethodsWe investigated the effects of nicotine on synaptic plasticity and hippocampus–prefrontal cortex (PFC)–amygdala-dependent memory formation in the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) and F344 control rats.ResultsChronic nicotine treatment (0.4 mg/kg nicotine, base, subcutaneously) significantly attenuated the cognitive deficits in the HIV-1Tg rats in both the spatial and contextual fear memories but impaired the contextual learning memory in the F344 rats. To determine the role of nicotine in the synaptic dysfunction caused by HIV-1 proteins, we analyzed the expression of key representative genes related to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, PFC, and amygdala of the HIV-1Tg and F344 rats using a custom-designed qRT-PCR array. The HIV-1 proteins significantly altered the glutamate receptor-mediated intracellular calcium cascade and its downstream signaling cascade in a brain region-specific manner. Further, chronic nicotine treatment reversed the effect of HIV-1 proteins on the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity in the three brain regions. The effects of nicotine differed significantly in the HIV-1Tg and F344 rats.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that nicotine can attenuate the effect of HIV viral proteins on cognitive function and produce a brain region- and strain-specific effect on the intracellular signaling cascades involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation.","HIV, Nicotine, Brain, Spatial working memory, Contextual memory, Synaptic plasticity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0134-x,2015

However, how functional presynaptic terminal density is regulated under natural physiological conditions is still poorly understood.ResultsWe studied the factors controlling the density of presynaptic functional terminals at single dendritic branches of hippocampal neurons and found that elevation of intracellular Mg2+ concentration was effective in increasing the density of functional terminals. Interestingly, the upregulation was not due to synaptogenesis, but to the conversion of a considerable proportion of presynaptic terminals from nonfunctional to functional. Mechanistic studies revealed that the nonfunctional terminals had inadequate Ca2+-sensitivity-related proteins, resulting in very low Ca2+ sensitivity within their vesicle release machinery. We identified energy-dependent axonal transport as a primary factor controlling the amount of Ca2+-sensitivity-related proteins in terminals. The elevation of intracellular Mg2+ enhanced local energy supply and promoted the increase of Ca2+-sensitivity-related proteins in terminals, leading to increased functional terminal density.ConclusionsOur study suggests that local energy supply plays a critical role in controlling the density of functional presynaptic terminals, demonstrating the link between energy supply and efficacy of synaptic transmission.","Density of functional presynaptic terminals, Energy supply, Presynaptic Ca2+ sensitivity, Ca2+-sensitivity-related proteins, Axonal transport, Intracellular Mg2+",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0132-z,2015

Pasternak,spasternak@robarts.ca,2015-07-14,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of Beta-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the brain. Aβ peptides are generated by cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the β − and γ − secretase enzymes. Although this process is tightly linked to the internalization of cell surface APP, the compartments responsible are not well defined. We have found that APP can be rapidly internalized from the cell surface to lysosomes, bypassing early and late endosomes. Here we show by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy that this pathway is mediated by macropinocytosis. APP internalization is enhanced by antibody binding/crosslinking of APP suggesting that APP may function as a receptor. Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of Arf6 blocks direct transport of APP to lysosomes, but does not affect classical endocytosis to endosomes. Arf6 expression increases through the hippocampus with the development of Alzheimer’s disease, being expressed mostly in the CA1 and CA2 regions in normal individuals but spreading through the CA3 and CA4 regions in individuals with pathologically diagnosed AD. Disruption of lysosomal transport of APP reduces both Aβ40 and Aβ42 production by more than 30 %. Our findings suggest that the lysosome is an important site for Aβ production and that altering APP trafficking represents a viable strategy to reduce Aβ production.","Amyloid Precursor Protein, Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing, SN56 Cell, Fluorescent Dextran, Arf6 Expression",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0129-7,2015

An increasing number of studies relate voluntary exercise with greater resilience to psychological stress, a process that is highly regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on stress resilience are still poorly understood. Here we have studied the impact of long term exercise and housing conditions on: a) hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1), b) epigenetic regulation of Nr3c1 (DNA methylation at the Nr3c1-1F promoter and miR-124 expression), c) anxiety (elevated plus maze, EPM), and d) adrenal gland weight and adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (Mc2r) expression.ResultsExercise increased Nr3c1 and Nr3c1-1F expression and decreased miR-124 levels in the hippocampus in single-housed mice, suggesting enhanced resilience to stress. The opposite was found for pair-housed animals. Bisulfite sequencing showed virtually no DNA methylation in the Nr3c1-1F promoter region. Single-housing increased the time spent on stretch attend postures. Exercise decreased the time spent at the open arms of the EPM, however, the mobility of the exercise groups was significantly lower. Exercise had opposite effects on the adrenal gland weight of single and pair-housed mice, while it had no effect on adrenal Mc2r expression.ConclusionsThese results suggest that exercise exerts a positive impact on stress resilience in single-housed mice that could be mediated by decreasing miR-124 and increasing Nr3c1 expression in the hippocampus.

They play important roles in spermatogenesis, stem cell maintenance, piRNA biogenesis, and transposon silencing. Interestingly a recent study showed that de novo mutations of PIWI family members are strongly associated with autism.ResultsHere, we report that PIWI-like 1 (PIWIL1), a PIWI family member known to be essential for the transition of round spermatid into elongated spermatid, plays a role in the polarization and radial migration of newborn neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. Knocking down PIWIL1 in newborn cortical neurons by in utero electroporation of specific siRNAs resulted in retardation of the transition of neurons from the multipolar stage to the bipolar stage followed by a defect in their radial migration to the proper destination. Domain analysis showed that both the RNA binding PAZ domain and the RNA processing PIWI domain in PIWIL1 were indispensable for its function in neuronal migration. Furthermore, we found that PIWIL1 unexpectedly regulates the expression of microtubule-associated proteins in cortical neurons.ConclusionsPIWIL1 regulates neuronal polarization and radial migration partly via modulating the expression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).

The depolarizing EGABA shift was much larger in rats in third, than first, lactation such that GABA exerted an excitatory, instead of inhibitory, effect in most of the MNCs of these multiparous rats. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that GABAergic excitation was found in both AVP and oxytocin neurons within the MNC population. Pharmacological experiments indicated that the up-regulation of the Cl− importer Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter isotype 1 and the down-regulation of the Cl− extruder K+-Cl− cotransporter isotype 2 were responsible for the depolarizing shift of EGABA and the resultant emergence of GABAergic excitation in the MNCs of the multiparous rats.ConclusionWe conclude that, in primiparous rats, the GABAergic inhibition of MNCs is weakened during the period of lactation while, in multiparous females, GABA becomes excitatory in a majority of the cells.

In neural stem cells, UPF3B protein was detected in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Similarly in neurons, UPF3B protein was detected in neurites, the somatic cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In both cell types nuclear UPF3B protein was enriched in the nucleolus. Using GFP tagged UPF3B proteins we found that the missense mutations did not affect the cellular localisation. Expression of missense mutant UPF3B disturbed neuronal differentiation and reduced the complexity of the branching of neurites. Neuronal differentiation was similarly affected in the presence of the NMD inhibitor Amlexanox. The expression of mutant UPF3B proteins lead to a subtle increase in mRNA levels of selected NMD targets.ConclusionsTogether our findings indicate that, despite the down-regulation of NMD factors, functional NMD is critical for neuronal differentiation. We propose that the neurodevelopmental phenotype of UPF3B missense mutation is caused by impairment of NMD function altering neuronal differentiation.","Autism, Schizophrenia, X-linked intellectual disability, Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, UPF3B mutation, UPF1, Tethered function assay, qPCR, Arhgap24, Atf4, Protein localisation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0122-1,2015

Although abnormal regulation of neuronal genes due to mutant MeCP2 is thought to induce autistic behavior and impaired development in RTT patients, precise cellular mechanisms underlying the aberrant neural progression remain unclear.ResultsTwo sets of isogenic pairs of either wild-type or mutant MECP2-expressing human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines were generated from a single pair of 10-year-old RTT-monozygotic (MZ) female twins. Mutant MeCP2-expressing hiPSC lines did not express detectable MeCP2 protein during any stage of differentiation. The lack of MeCP2 reflected altered gene expression patterns in differentiated neural cells rather than in undifferentiated hiPSCs, as assessed by microarray analysis. Furthermore, MeCP2 deficiency in the neural cell lineage increased astrocyte-specific differentiation from multipotent neural stem cells. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and bisulfite sequencing assays indicated that anomalous glial fibrillary acidic protein gene (GFAP) expression in the MeCP2-negative, differentiated neural cells resulted from the absence of MeCP2 binding to the GFAP gene.ConclusionsAn isogenic RTT-hiPSC model demonstrated that MeCP2 participates in the differentiation of neural cells. Moreover, MeCP2 deficiency triggers perturbation of astrocytic gene expression, yielding accelerated astrocyte formation from RTT-hiPSC-derived neural stem cells. These findings are likely to shed new light on astrocytic abnormalities in RTT, and suggest that astrocytes, which are required for neuronal homeostasis and function, might be a new target of RTT therapy.","Rett syndrome, Methyl CpG-binding protein 2/MeCP2, Induced pluripotent stem cell, Neural stem cell, Astrocytes, DNA methylation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0121-2,2015

Research indicates that the brain neuronal temporal coding and synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) are critical in memory and perception. We studied the effects of cisplatin on induction of LTP in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) pathway, characterized the coordination of spike timing with local theta oscillation, and identified synchrony in the BLA-ACC network integrity.ResultsIn the study presented, the impacts of cisplatin on emotional and cognitive functions were investigated by elevated plus-maze test, Morris water maze test, and rat Iowa gambling task (RGT). Electrophysiological recordings were conducted to study long-term potentiation. Simultaneous recordings from multi-electrodes were performed to characterize the neural spike firing and ongoing theta oscillation of local field potential (LFP), and to clarify the synchronization of large scale of theta oscillation in the BLA-ACC pathway. Cisplatin-treated rats demonstrated anxiety- like behavior, exhibited impaired spatial reference memory. RGT showed decrease of the percentage of good decision-makers, and increase in the percentage of maladaptive behavior (delay-good decision-makers plus poor decision-makers). Cisplatin suppressed the LTP, and disrupted the phase-locking of ACC single neural firings to the ongoing theta oscillation; further, cisplatin interrupted the synchrony in the BLA-ACC pathway.ConclusionsWe provide the first direct evidence that the cisplatin interrupts theta-frequency phase-locking of ACC neurons.

However, programmed cell death (PCD) provoked by the harsh conditions evident in the diseased brain greatly undermines the potential of NSCs. Currently, the mechanisms of PCD that effect NSCs remain largely unknown.ResultsWe have previously reported that hippocampal neural stem (HCN) cells derived from the adult rat brain undergo autopahgic cell death (ACD) following insulin withdrawal without hallmarks of apoptosis despite their normal apoptotic capabilities. In this study, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) induces ACD in insulin-deprived HCN cells. Both pharmacological and genetic inactivation of GSK-3β significantly decreased ACD, while activation of GSK-3β increased autophagic flux and caused more cell death without inducing apoptosis following insulin withdrawal. In contrast, knockdown of GSK-3α barely affected ACD, lending further support to the critical role of GSK-3β.ConclusionCollectively, these data demonstrate that GSK-3β is a key regulator of ACD in HCN cells following insulin withdrawal. The absence of apoptotic indices in GSK-3β-induced cell death in insulin-deprived HCN cells corroborates the notion that HCN cell death following insulin withdrawal represents the genuine model of ACD in apoptosis-intact mammalian cells and identifies GSK-3β as a key negative effector of NSC survival downstream of insulin signaling.","Hippocampal neural stem cells, Programmed cell death, Autophagic cell death, Glycogen synthase kinase-3β, Apoptosis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0119-9,2015

Recent studies have suggested that the 5-HT4 receptor is involved in both effects. However, it is largely unknown how the 5-HT4 receptor mediates neurogenic effects in the DG and, how the neurogenic and dematuration effects of SSRIs interact with each other.ResultsWe addressed these issues using 5-HT4 receptor knockout (5-HT4R KO) mice. Expression of the 5-HT4 receptor was detected in mature GCs but not in neuronal progenitors of the DG. We found that chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine significantly increased cell proliferation and the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the DG of wild-type mice, but not in 5-HT4R KO mice. We then examined the correlation between the increased neurogenesis and the dematuration of GCs. As reported previously, reduced expression of calbindin in the DG, as an index of dematuration, by chronic fluoxetine treatment was observed in wild-type mice but not in 5-HT4R KO mice. The proliferative effect of fluoxetine was inversely correlated with the expression level of calbindin in the DG. The expression of neurogenic factors in the DG, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), was also associated with the progression of dematuration. These results indicate that the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine in the DG are closely associated with the progression of dematuration of GCs. In contrast, the DG in which neurogenesis was impaired by irradiation still showed significant reduction of calbindin expression by chronic fluoxetine treatment, suggesting that dematuration of GCs by fluoxetine does not require adult neurogenesis in the DG.ConclusionsWe demonstrated that the 5-HT4 receptor plays an important role in fluoxetine-induced adult neurogenesis in the DG in addition to GC dematuration, and that these phenomena are closely associated. Our results suggest that 5-HT4 receptor-mediated phenotypic changes, including dematuration in mature GCs, underlie the neurogenic effect of SSRIs in the DG, providing new insight into the cellular mechanisms of the neurogenic actions of SSRIs in the hippocampus.","Antidepressant, Neurogenesis, 5-HT4 receptor, Hippocampus, Maturation, Granule cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0120-3,2015

Three transcription factors, Foxn4, RORβ1 and their downstream effector Ptf1a, have been shown to be indispensable intrinsic regulators for the differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells. At present, however, it is unclear how Ptf1a specifies these two cell fates from competent retinal precursors. Here, through combined bioinformatic, molecular and genetic approaches in mouse retinas, we identify the Tfap2a and Tfap2b transcription factors as two major downstream effectors of Ptf1a. RNA-seq and immunolabeling analyses show that the expression of Tfap2a and 2b transcripts and proteins is dramatically downregulated in the Ptf1a null mutant retina. Their overexpression is capable of promoting the differentiation of glycinergic and GABAergic amacrine cells at the expense of photoreceptors much as misexpressed Ptf1a is, whereas their simultaneous knockdown has the opposite effect. Given the demonstrated requirement for Tfap2a and 2b in horizontal cell differentiation, our study thus defines a Foxn4/RORβ1-Ptf1a-Tfap2a/2b transcriptional regulatory cascade that underlies the competence, specification and differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells during retinal development.","Tfap2, Ptf1a, Foxn4, Amacrine cell, Horizontal cell, Retinal development",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0118-x,2015

Oxidative stress is considered a causative factor in late onset/age-related AD, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is important for the catabolism of toxic aldehydes associated with oxidative stress. One such toxic aldehyde, the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), accumulates in AD brain and is associated with AD pathology. Given this linkage, we hypothesized that in mice lacking ALDH2, there would be increases in HNE and the appearance of AD-like pathological changes.ResultsChanges in relevant AD markers in Aldh2

Age-related memory deficits in the novel object recognition and Y maze tasks begin at 3.5-4 months and are maximal at 6.5-7 months. There was decreased performance in the Morris Water Maze task in 6 month old Aldh2

These mice exhibited endothelial dysfunction, increased amyloid-beta in cerebral microvessels, decreases in carbachol-induced pCREB and pERK formation in hippocampal slices, and brain atrophy. These AD-associated pathological changes are rarely observed as a constellation in current AD animal models.ConclusionsWe believe that this new model of age-related cognitive impairment will provide new insight into the pathogenesis and molecular/cellular mechanisms driving neurodegenerative diseases of aging such as AD, and will prove useful for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic agents for improving memory and for slowing, preventing, or reversing AD progression.","Alzheimer’s disease, Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, 4-hydroxynonenal, Oxidative stress, AD mouse model, Cognitive deficits, Synaptic function",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0117-y,2015

First we found that deletion of Pten promotes neuronal differentiation. To determine whether the protein or lipid phosphatase activity is required for regulating neuronal differentiation, we generated phosphatase domain-specific Pten mutations. Interestingly, only expression of protein phosphatase-deficient mutant Y138L could mimic the effect of knocking down Pten, suggesting the protein phosphatase of Pten is critical for regulating NPC differentiation. Importantly, we showed that the wild-type and lipid phosphatase mutant (G129E) forms of Pten are able to rescue neuronal differentiation in Pten knockout NPCs, but mutants containing protein phosphatase mutant cannot.

On the other hand, the genetic repertoire governing the maintenance and fate decision of neural progenitor pool in the cerebellum has remained elusive.ResultsBy employing the Cre/loxP strategy, we specifically inactivated Sox9 in the mouse cerebellum. Unexpectedly, the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of neural progenitors at the cerebellar ventricular zone (VZ) were not perturbed upon Sox9 ablation. Instead, the mutants exhibited an increased number of VZ-derived neurons including Purkinje cells and GABAergic interneurons. Simultaneously, we observed continuous neurogenesis from Sox9-null VZ at late gestation, when normally neurogenesis ceases to occur and gives way for gliogenesis.

However, it is still unclear which specific brain substrates contribute to mGluR5-mediated regulation of motor function.ResultsThus, to better understand the role of mGluR5 in motor control and to determine which neural substrates are involved in this regulation we performed stereotactic microinfusions of the mGluR5 antagonist, MPEP, into specific brain regions and submitted mice to the open field and rotarod apparatus. Our findings indicate that mGluR5 blockage elicits distinct outcomes in terms of locomotor activity and motor coordination depending on the brain region injected with mGluR5 antagonist. MPEP injection into either the dorsal striatum or dorsal hippocampus resulted in increased locomotor activity, whereas MPEP injection into either the ventral striatum or motor cortex resulted in hypokinesia. Moreover, MPEP injected into the olfactory bulb increased the distance mice traveled in the center of the open field arena. With respect to motor coordination on the rotarod, injection of MPEP into the motor cortex and olfactory bulb elicited decreased latency to fall.ConclusionsTaken together, our data suggest that not only primarily motor neural substrates, but also limbic and sensory structures are involved in mGluR5-mediated motor behavior.","mGluR5, Locomotor activity, Motor coordination, Striatum, Hippocampus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0113-2,2015

Recent studies have shown that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is involved in the innate immune response in various neurological diseases, yet neither its role in ICH nor the mechanisms by which it functions have yet been elucidated. We examined these in this study using a collagenase-induced mouse ICH model with TLR2 knock-out (KO) mice.ResultsTLR2 expression was upregulated in the ipsilateral hemorrhagic tissues of the collagenase-injected mice. Brain injury volume and neurological deficits following ICH were reduced in TLR2 KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) control mice. Heterologous blood-transfer experiments show that TLR2 signaling in brain-resident cells, but not leukocytes, contributes to the injury. In our study to elucidate underlying mechanisms, we found that damage to blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity following ICH was attenuated in TLR2 KO mice compared to WT mice, which may be due to reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) activation in astrocytes. The reduced BBB damage accompanies decreased neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression in the injured brain parenchyma, which may account for the attenuated brain damage in TLR2 KO mice after ICH.ConclusionsTLR2 plays a detrimental role in ICH-induced brain damage by activating MMP9 in astrocytes, compromising BBB, and enhancing neutrophils infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression.","Toll-like receptor, Stroke, Neuroinflammation, Neutrophil, Matrix metalloproteinase-9",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0116-z,2015

While CS–US associations are generally thought to occur in the amygdala, the pathway mediating US signal processing has only been partially identified. The external part of the pontine lateral parabrachial nucleus (elPB) is well situated for providing US nociceptive information to the central amygdala (CeA), which was recently revealed to play a primary role in fear acquisition. Therefore, we manipulated the elPB activity to examine its role in the regulation of fear learning.ResultsFirst, we transiently inactivate the elPB during the acquisition of fear memory. Mice received bilateral elPB injections of the GABAA agonist muscimol (MUS) or phosphate-buffered saline (drug control), with bilateral misplacement of MUS defined as a placement control group. After the injection, mice were conditioned with a pure tone and foot-shock. On a memory retrieval test on day 2, the freezing ratio was significantly lower in the MUS group compared with that in the drug control or placement control groups. A second retrieval test using a pip tone on day 4 following de novo training on day 3, resulted in significant freezing with no group differences, indicating integrity of fear learning and a temporary limited effect of MUS. Next, we examined whether selectively activating the elPB-CeC pathway is sufficient to induce fear learning when paired with CS. Mice with channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) expressed in the elPB received a pure tone (CS) in association with optical stimulation in the CeA (CS-LED paired group). On the retrieval test, CS-LED paired mice exhibited significantly higher freezing ratios evoked by CS presentation compared with both control mice receiving optical stimulation immediately after being placed in the shock chamber and exposed to the CS much later (immediate shock group) and those expressing only GFP (GFP control group). These results suggest that selective stimulation of the elPB-CeC pathway substitutes for the US to induce fear learning.ConclusionsThe elPB activity is necessary and sufficient to trigger fear learning, likely as a part of the pathway transmitting aversive signals to the CeA.","Fear conditioning, Associative learning, Nociception, Unconditioned stimulus, Amygdala, Channelrhodopsin, Virus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0108-z,2015

However, it is now recognized that mGluR5a also functions as a receptor for cellular prion protein (PrPC) and β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42) oligomers to facilitate intracellular signaling via the resulting protein complex. Intracellular mGluR5a signaling is also regulated by its association with a wide variety of intracellular regulation proteins.ResultsIn the present study, we utilized mass spectroscopy to identify calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) as a protein that interacts with the second intracellular loop domain of mGluR5. We show that CaMKIIα interacts with both mGluR1a and mGluR5a in an agonist-independent manner and is co-immunoprecipitated with mGluR5a from hippocampal mouse brain. CaMKIIα positively regulates both mGluR1a and mGluR5a endocytosis, but selectively attenuates mGluR5a but not mGluR1a-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a kinase activity-dependent manner. We also find that Aβ42 oligomers stimulate the association of CaMKIIα with mGluR5a and activate ERK1/2 in an mGluR5a-dependent manner. However, Aβ42 oligomer-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation is not regulated by mGluR5a/CaMKIIα interactions suggesting that agonist and Aβ42 oligomers stabilize distinct mGluR5a activation states that are differentially regulated by CaMKIIα. The expression of both mGluR5a and PrPC together, but not alone resulted in the agonist-stimulated subcellular distribution of CaMKIIα into cytoplasmic puncta.ConclusionsTaken together these results indicate that CaMKIIα selectively regulates mGluR1a and mGluR5a ERK1/2 signaling.

However, our previous investigations suggest that therapeutic BACE1 suppression may be beneficial only if targeted on earlier stages of AD and encounter dramatic reductions in efficacy during disease progression. This study was designed to test the possibility that a combination approach, aimed at inhibiting BACE1 and boosting neprilysin (a major Aβ-degrading enzyme) activities, may be able to mechanistically overcome the limited efficacy of anti-Aβ therapy in advanced AD.ResultsAfter crossbreeding between BACE1 heterozygous knockout (BACE1+/−), neprilysin transgenic (NEP) and 5XFAD mice, we analyzed the resultant mice at 12 months of age when 5XFAD controls showed robust amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and elevation of BACE1 expression (~2 folds). Although haploinsufficiency lowered BACE1 expression by ~50% in concordance with reduction in gene copy number, profound β-amyloidosis, memory deficits and cholinergic neuron death were no longer rescued in BACE1+/− · 5XFAD mice concomitant with their persistently upregulated BACE1 (i.e., equivalent to wild-type control levels). Notably, neprilysin overexpression not only prevented Aβ accumulation but also suppressed the translation initiation factor eIF2α-associated elevation of BACE1 and lowered levels of the β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) in NEP · 5XFAD mice. Interestingly, these markers for β-amyloidogenesis in BACE1+/− · NEP · 5XFAD mice were further reduced to the levels reflecting a combination of single BACE1 allele ablation and the abolishment of translational BACE1 upregulation. However, since neprilysin overexpression was striking (~8-fold relative to wild-type controls), memory impairments, cholinergic neuronal loss and β-amyloidosis were similarly prevented in NEP · 5XFAD and BACE1+/− · NEP · 5XFAD mice.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that robust overexpression of neprilysin is sufficient to ameliorate AD-like phenotypes in aged 5XFAD mice. We also found that Aβ-degrading effects of overexpressed neprilysin can block deleterious BACE1-elevating mechanisms that accelerate Aβ production, warranting further study to test whether interventions moderately activating neprilysin may be useful for boosting the limited efficacy of therapeutic BACE1 inhibition in treating AD with established Aβ pathology.","Alzheimer’s disease, Amyloid-β, β-Secretase, BACE1, Neprilysin, C99, Learning and memory, Fear conditioning, Cholinergic neuron, 5XFAD",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0110-5,2015
Glutamate receptors function as scaffolds for the regulation of β-amyloid and cellular prion protein signaling complexes,"Alison Hamilton1,2,, Gerald W Zamponi3 &, Stephen S G Ferguson1,2",Stephen S G Ferguson,ferguson@robarts.ca,2015-03-24,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects 36 million people worldwide, but currently has no effective treatment options. One of the original hallmarks of AD are plaques comprised of beta amyloid (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of phosphorylated Tau protein. However, it is soluble oligomeric Aβ which is more closely correlated with cognitive decline and is therefore considered to be the neurotoxic species. Oligomeric Aβ has recently been shown to form complexes with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, cellular prion protein (PrPc), and these complexes are believed to play an important role in the progression of AD pathogenesis. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter is responsible for mediating learning and memory under normal physiological conditions. However, the dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has also been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Glutamate acts via both ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), each of which have been implicated in AD. There is now growing evidence to suggest that mGluR5 may contribute the AD pathogenesis by acting as scaffolds for the PrPc/Aβ oligomer complex, enabling the propagation of neurotoxic signaling in AD. In addition, PrPc and Aβ oligomer signaling via NMDARs may also contribute to AD pathology. The current review overviews our current understanding of the role of PrPc and Aβ oligomers in regulating glutamate receptor signaling, as well as highlights the importance of understanding these signaling complexes to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to treat AD.","Alzheimer’s disease, β-amyloid, Cellular prion protein, Glutamate, APPswe/PS1ΔE9, Metabotropic glutamate receptor, NMDA, Neurodegeneration",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0107-0,2015

Damage and/or malfunction of the nervous system causes serious pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, not surprising, considerable research effort, both in vivo and in vitro, has been devoted to studying the nervous system and signal transmission through it. However, conventional in vitro cell culture systems do not enable control over diverse aspects of the neural microenvironment. Moreover, formation of certain nervous system growth patterns in vitro remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a deep hemispherical, microchannel-networked, concave array system and applied it to generate three-dimensional nerve-like neural bundles. The deep hemicylindrical channel network was easily fabricated by exploiting the meniscus induced by the surface tension of a liquid poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) prepolymer. Neurospheroids spontaneously aggregated in each deep concave microwell and were networked to neighboring spheroids through the deep hemicylindrical channel. Notably, two types of satellite spheroids also formed in deep hemispherical microchannels through self-aggregation and acted as an anchoring point to enhance formation of nerve-like networks with neighboring spheroids. During neural-network formation, neural progenitor cells successfully differentiated into glial and neuronal cells. These cells secreted laminin, forming an extracellular matrix around the host and satellite spheroids. Electrical stimuli were transmitted between networked neurospheroids in the resulting nerve-like neural bundle, as detected by imaging Ca2+ signals in responding cells.","Neurospheroid, Neural spheroid networking, Deep hemicylindrical channel, Neural bundle, Nerve-like structure",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0109-y,2015

Peripherally restricted α2-AR antagonist could block the analgesic effect of systemic DEX on neuropathic pain, with no effect on sedation, indicating peripheral analgesic effect of DEX. Tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channel Nav1.8 play important roles in the conduction of nociceptive sensation. Both α2-AR and Nav1.8 are found in small nociceptive DRG neurons. We, therefore, investigated the effects of DEX on the Nav1.8 currents in acutely dissociated small-diameter DRG neurons.ResultsWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that DEX concentration-dependently suppressed TTX-R Nav1.8 currents in small-diameter lumbar DRG neurons. DEX also shifted the steady-state inactivation curves of Nav1.8 in a hyperpolarizing direction and increased the threshold of action potential and decrease electrical and chemical stimuli-evoked firings in small-diameter DRG neurons. The α2-AR antagonist yohimbine or α2A-AR antagonist BRL44408 but not α2B-AR antagonist imiloxan blocked the inhibition of Nav1.8 currents by DEX. Immunohistochemistry results showed that Nav1.8 was predominantly expressed in peripherin-positive small-diameter DRG neurons, and some of them were α2A-AR-positive ones. Our electrophysiological recordings also demonstrated that DEX-induced inhibition of Nav1.8 currents was prevented by intracellular application of G-protein inhibitor GDPβ-s or Gi/o proteins inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX), and bath application of adenylate cyclase (AC) activator forskolin or membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-Bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP).

The model involved exposure of an intruder (subject) mouse to a resident aggressor mouse followed by exposure to trauma reminders with rest periods. C57BL/6 mice exposed to SJL aggressor mice exhibited behaviors suggested as PTSD-in-mouse phenotypes: intermittent freezing, reduced locomotion, avoidance of the aggressor-associated cue and apparent startled jumping. Brain tissues (amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, septal region, corpus striatum and ventral striatum) from subject (aggressor exposed: Agg-E) and control C57BL/6 mice were collected at one, 10 and 42 days post aggressor exposure sessions. Transcripts in these brain regions were assayed using Agilent’s mouse genome-wide arrays.ResultsPathways and biological processes associated with differentially regulated genes were mainly those thought to be involved in fear-related behavioral responses and neuronal signaling. Expression-based assessments of activation patterns showed increased activations of pathways related to anxiety disorders (hyperactivity and fear responses), impaired cognition, mood disorders, circadian rhythm disruption, and impaired territorial and aggressive behaviors. In amygdala, activations of these pathways were more pronounced at earlier time-points, with some attenuation after longer rest periods. In hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, activation patterns were observed at later time points. Signaling pathways associated with PTSD-comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, metabolic disorder, inflammation and cardiac infarction, were also significantly enriched. In contrast, signaling processes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity were inhibited.ConclusionsOur data suggests activations of behavioral responses associated with anxiety disorders as well as inhibition of neuronal signaling pathways important for neurogenesis, cognition and extinction of fear memory.

However, little is known about the timing and cell type specificity of the expression of HCN isoforms during development of the hippocampus.ResultsHere we examined the developmental expression of the brain-enriched HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 isoforms of HCN channels in mouse hippocampus from embryonic to postnatal stages. All these isoforms were expressed abundantly in the hippocampus at embryonic day 14.5 and postnatal day 0. Each HCN channel isoform showed subfield-specific expression within the hippocampus from postnatal day 7, and only HCN4 was found in glial cells in the stratum lacunosum moleculare at this developmental stage. At postnatal days 21 and 56, all HCN isoforms were strongly expressed in the stratum lacunosum moleculare and the stratum pyramidale of the Cornu Ammonis (CA), as well as in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, but not in the subgranular zone. Furthermore, the immunolabeling for all these isoforms was colocalized with parvalbumin immunolabeling in interneurons of the CA field and in the dentate gyrus.ConclusionsOur mapping data showing the temporal and spatial changes in the expression of HCN channels suggest that HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 subunits may have distinct physiological roles in the developing hippocampus.","HCN channels, Hippocampus, Neurodevelopment, Dentate gyrus, Cornu Ammonis, Stratum lacunosum moleculare, Immunohistochemistry",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0103-4,2015

Despite the common use of viral vectors to direct ectopic expression of transgenes within the nervous system, creating high titer viral vectors that are capable of expressing very large transgenes or difficult to express transgenes imposes unique challenges. Here we describe the development of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) and lentiviruses designed to express the large and difficult to express GluN2A or GluN2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor, specifically within neurons.ResultsWe created a number of custom designed AAV and lentiviral vectors that were optimized for large transgenes, by minimizing DNA sequences that were not essential, utilizing short promoter sequences of 8 widely used promoters (RSV, EFS, TRE3G, 0.4αCaMKII, 1.3αCaMKII, 0.5Synapsin, 1.1Synapsin and CMV) and utilizing a very short (~75 bps) 3′ untranslated sequence. Not surprisingly these promoters differed in their ability to express the GluN2 subunits, however surprisingly we found that the neuron specific synapsin and αCaMKII, promoters were incapable of conferring detectable expression of full length GluN2 subunits and detectable expression could only be achieved from these promoters if the transgene included an intron or if the GluN2 subunit transgenes were truncated to only include the coding regions of the GluN2 transmembrane domains.ConclusionsWe determined that viral packaging limit, transgene promoter and the presence of an intron within the transgene were all important factors that contributed to being able to successfully develop viral vectors designed to deliver and express GluN2 transgenes in a neuron specific manner. Because these vectors have been optimized to accommodate large open reading frames and in some cases contain an intron to facilitate expression of difficult to express transgenes, these viral vectors likely could be useful for delivering and expressing many large or difficult to express transgenes in a neuron specific manner.","NMDA, GluN2, AAV, Lenti, Viral vector, Amygdala, TRE3G",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0100-7,2015

This study investigated the effects of carvacrol on neuronal injury and behavioral impairment after hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal mice and the potential signaling pathway underlying these effects.ResultsCarvacrol inhibited TRPM7 current in HEK293 cells over-expressing TRPM7 and TRPM7-like current in hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Carvacrol (>200 μM) reduced OGD-induced neuronal injury in cortical neurons. 24 hours after HI, TRPM7 protein level in the ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly higher than in the contralateral hemisphere. Carvacrol (30 and 50 mg/kg) pre-treatment reduced brain infarct volume 24 hours after HI in a dose-dependent manner. Carvacrol pre-treatment also improved neurobehavioral outcomes.

Many neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to reflect altered patterns of synaptic connectivity, including imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Developing rapid throughput approaches for assessing synaptogenesis will facilitate toxicologic and drug screening studies of neurodevelopmental disorders. The current study describes the use of high-content imaging to quantify the ontogeny of excitatory and inhibitory synapses using in vitro models of neurodevelopment. These data are compared to biochemical and functional measures of synaptogenesis.ResultsThe ontogenetic patterns of synapse formation were compared between primary rodent hippocampal and cortical neurons over 28 days in vitro (DIV). As determined by ELISA, the increase in synaptophysin expression levels as cultures matured was similar between hippocampal and cortical cultures. High-content imaging of immunoreactivity of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic biomarkers demonstrated an overall greater number of synapses in hippocampal relative to cortical neurons with marked differences in the pattern of inhibitory synapse development between these two neuronal cell types. Functional assays revealed that both the mean firing rates and mean bursting rates were significantly increased in cortical cultures relative to hippocampal cultures. This difference may reflect decreased inhibitory synaptic tone in cortical versus hippocampal cultures.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate differences and similarities in the ontogeny of synaptogenesis between hippocampal and cortical neurons, depending on the biological level examined. Assessment of synaptophysin protein levels by ELISA showed a general increase in synapse formation in both cell types with increasing time in culture, while high-content imaging was able to delineate cell type-dependent differences in formation of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses. The functional significance of differences in the balance of excitatory to inhibitory synapses was confirmed by the assessment of network activity using microelectrode arrays. These results suggest that high-content imaging and microelectrode arrays provide complementary approaches for quantitative assessment of synaptogenesis, which should provide a robust readout of toxicologic and pharmacologic effects on this critical neurodevelopmental event.","Cortical neurons, Excitatory synapses, Inhibitory synapses, Hippocampal neurons, Primary neuronal cell cultures, Synaptogenesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0099-9,2015

Although various PKC isoforms can be expressed at the synaptic sites and specific cell distribution may contribute to their functional diversity, little is known about the isoform-specific functions of PKCs in neuromuscular synapse. The present study is designed to examine the location of the novel isoform nPKCε at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), their synaptic activity-related expression changes, its regulation by muscle contraction, and their possible involvement in acetylcholine release.ResultsWe use immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to demonstrate that the novel isoform nPKCε is exclusively located in the motor nerve terminals of the adult rat NMJ. We also report that electrical stimulation of synaptic inputs to the skeletal muscle significantly increased the amount of nPKCε isoform as well as its phosphorylated form in the synaptic membrane, and muscle contraction is necessary for these nPKCε expression changes. The results also demonstrate that synaptic activity-induced muscle contraction promotes changes in presynaptic nPKCε through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) signaling. Moreover, nPKCε activity results in phosphorylation of the substrate MARCKS involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and related with neurotransmission. Finally, blocking nPKCε with a nPKCε-specific translocation inhibitor peptide (εV1-2) strongly reduces phorbol ester-induced ACh release potentiation, which further indicates that nPKCε is involved in neurotransmission.ConclusionsTogether, these results provide a mechanistic insight into how synaptic activity-induced muscle contraction could regulate the presynaptic action of the nPKCε isoform and suggest that muscle contraction is an important regulatory step in TrkB signaling at the NMJ.","PKC, PKC epsilon, Neuromuscular junction, Neurotransmission, Immunofluorescence, Electrical stimulation, Muscle contraction, TrkB",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0098-x,2015

However, the mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease are not well known. Further, it is unclear why synapses in AD cerebellum are protected from degeneration. Our recent work on the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator p25 suggested that expression of the multifunctional presynaptic molecule cysteine string protein alpha (CSPalpha) may be affected in Alzheimer’s disease.ResultsUsing western blots and immunohistochemistry, we found that CSPalpha expression is reduced in hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus in Alzheimer’s disease. Reduced CSPalpha expression occurred before synaptophysin levels drop, suggesting that it contributes to the initial stages of synaptic degeneration. Surprisingly, we also found that CSPalpha expression is upregulated in cerebellum in Alzheimer’s disease. This CSPalpha upregulation reached the same level as in young, healthy cerebellum. We tested the idea whether CSPalpha upregulation might be neuroprotective, using htau mice, a model of tauopathy that expresses the entire wild-type human tau gene in the absence of mouse tau. In htau mice CSPalpha expression was found to be elevated at times when neuronal loss did not occur.ConclusionOur findings provide evidence that the presynaptic vesicle protein CSPalpha is a key player in synaptic degeneration and protection in Alzheimer’s disease. In the forebrain CSPalpha expression is reduced early in the disease and this may contribute to the initial stages of synaptic degeneration. In the cerebellum CSPalpha expression is upregulated to young, healthy levels and this may protect cerebellar synapses and neurons to survive.

In addition, chronic activity blockade reduces total potassium current, as well as protein expression and current of voltage-gated Kv1 and Kv7 potassium channels, which are critical regulators of action potential firing. Importantly, inhibition of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors alone mimics the effects of tetrodotoxin, including the elevation in firing frequency and reduction of potassium channel gene expression and current driven by activity blockade, whereas inhibition of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels has no effect.ConclusionsCollectively, our data suggest that homeostatic intrinsic plasticity induced by chronic activity blockade is accomplished in part by decreased calcium influx through N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors and subsequent transcriptional down-regulation of potassium channel genes.","Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, Potassium channel, NMDA receptor, Action potential, Hippocampus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-015-0094-1,2015

Moreover, we identified a novel isoform of OLMALINC that was also up-regulated in the WM. RNA-interference (RNAi) knockdown of OLMALINC in oligodendrocytes, which are the major cell type in the WM, caused significant changes in the expression of genes regulating cytostructure, cell activation and membrane signaling. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that over 10% of the top 25 up- and down-regulated genes were involved in oligodendrocyte maturation.

More than 50 mutations have been identified affecting the human ATP1A2 and ATP1A3 genes that are known to cause rapid-onset Dystonia Parkinsonism, familial hemiplegic migraine, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, and variants of familial hemiplegic migraine with neurological complications including seizures and various mood disorders. In flies, mutations affecting the ATPalpha gene have dramatic phenotypes including altered longevity, neural dysfunction, neurodegeneration, myodegeneration, and striking locomotor impairment. Locomotor defects can manifest as conditional bang-sensitive (BS) or temperature-sensitive (TS) paralysis: phenotypes well-suited for genetic screening.ResultsWe performed a genome-wide deficiency screen using three distinct missense alleles of ATPalpha and conditional locomotor function assays to identify novel modifier loci. A secondary screen confirmed allele-specificity of the interactions and many of the interactions were mapped to single genes and subsequently validated. We successfully identified 64 modifier loci and used classical mutations and RNAi to confirm 50 single gene interactions.

However, multiprotein complexes have not been directly isolated from human synapses and the feasibility of their isolation from post-mortem tissue is unknown.ResultsHere we establish a screening assay and criteria to identify post-mortem brain samples containing well-preserved synapse proteomes, revealing that neocortex samples are best preserved.

In BE 24 hr rats, all of the metabolic changes observed returned to normal in the hippocampus and occipital cortex; however, levels of Glu, Gln, GABA, and glycine significantly increased in the cerebellum.ConclusionsThese metabolic changes for the neurotransmitters are mostly likely the result of a shift in the steady-state equilibrium of the Gln-Glu-GABA metabolic cycle between astrocytes and neurons, in a region-specific manner.

Increasingly, inappropriate activation of microglia is being reported as a component of inflammation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been observed to have anti-inflammatory and protective effects in both neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke, and are suggested to act by attenuating microglial activity.ResultsWe sought to investigate the effects of simvastatin treatment on the secretory profile and phagocytic activity of primary cultured rat microglia, and to dissect the mechanism of action of simvastatin on microglial activity. Simvastatin treatment altered the release of cytokines and trophic factors from microglia, including interleukin-1-β, tumour necrosis factor-α, and brain derived neurotrophic factor in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Conversely, simvastatin inhibited phagocytosis in microglia in a cholesterol-independent manner.ConclusionsThe disparity in cholesterol dependence of cytokine release and phagocytosis suggests the two effects occur through distinct molecular mechanisms.

However, knowledge on intracellular signaling cascades and gene expression programs activated by these inhibitors in neurons is sparse. Herein we studied intracellular signaling cascades activated by total myelin, Nogo and CSPGs in primary mouse CNS neurons.ResultsTotal myelin, Nogo and CSPGs stimulated gene expression activity of the serum response factor (SRF), a central gene regulator of immediate early (IEG) and actin cytoskeletal gene transcription. As demonstrated by pharmacological interference, SRF-mediated IEG activation by myelin, Nogo or CSPGs depended on MAP kinase, to a lesser extent on Rho-GTPase but not on PKA signaling. Stimulation of neurons with all three axon growth inhibitors activated the MAP kinase ERK. In addition to ERK activation, myelin activated the IEG c-Fos, an important checkpoint of neuronal survival vs. apoptosis. Employing Srf deficient neurons revealed that myelin-induced IEG activation requires SRF. This suggests an SRF function in mediating neuronal signaling evoked by axon regeneration associated inhibitors. Besides being a signaling target of axon growth inhibitors, we show that constitutively-active SRF-VP16 can be employed to circumvent neurite growth inhibition imposed by myelin, Nogo and CSPGs.ConclusionIn sum, our data demonstrate that axon regeneration inhibitors such as Nogo trigger gene expression programs including an SRF-dependent IEG response via MAP kinases and Rho-GTPases.","SRF, Immediate early gene, Axon, Regeneration, MAP kinase, Neuron, Myelin, c-Fos",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0086-6,2014

However, physiological function of TWIK-1, the first identified member of the mammalian K2P channel family, in neuronal cells is largely unknown.ResultsWe found that TWIK-1 proteins were expressed and localized mainly in the soma and proximal dendrites of dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) rather than in distal dendrites or mossy fibers. Gene silencing demonstrates that the outwardly rectifying K+ current density was reduced in TWIK-1-deficient granule cells. TWIK-1 deficiency caused a depolarizing shift in the resting membrane potential (RMP) of DGGCs and enhanced their firing rate in response to depolarizing current injections. Through perforant path stimulation, TWIK-1-deficient granule cells showed altered signal input-output properties with larger EPSP amplitude values and increased spiking compared to control DGGCs. In addition, supra-maximal perforant path stimulation evoked a graded burst discharge in 44% of TWIK-1-deficient cells, which implies impairment of EPSP-spike coupling.ConclusionsThese results showed that TWIK-1 is functionally expressed in DGGCs and contributes to the intrinsic excitability of these cells. The TWIK-1 channel is involved in establishing the RMP of DGGCs; it attenuates sub-threshold depolarization of the cells during neuronal activity, and contributes to EPSP-spike coupling in perforant path-to-granule cell synaptic transmission.","K2P channel, TWIK-1, Intrinsic excitability, Dentate gyrus granule cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0080-z,2014

The barrel cortex consists of barrel and septa columns, which receive various input signals through distinct pathways. The lemniscal pathway transmits whisker-specific signals to homologous barrel columns, and the paralemniscal pathway transmits multi-whisker signals to both barrel and septa columns. The integration of information from both lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways in the barrel cortex is critical for precise object recognition. As the main target of the posterior medial nucleus (POm) in the paralemniscal pathway, layer 5a (L5a) pyramidal neurons are involved in both barrel and septa circuits and are considered an important site of information integration. However, information on L5a neurons is very limited. This study aims to explore the cellular features of L5a neurons and to provide a morphological basis for studying their roles in the development of the paralemniscal pathway and in information integration.Results1. We found that the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR) is dynamically expressed in L5a excitatory pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex, and L5a neurons form a unique serrated pattern similar to the distributions of their presynaptic POm axon terminals.2. Infraorbital nerve transection disrupts this unique alignment, indicating that it is input dependent.3. The formation of the L5a neuronal alignment develops synchronously with barrels, which suggests that the lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways may interact with each other to regulate pattern formation and refinement in the barrel cortex.4. CR is specifically expressed in the paralemniscal pathway, and CR deletion disrupts the unique L5a neuronal pattern, which indicates that CR may be required for the development of the paralemniscal pathway.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that L5a neurons form a unique, input-dependent serrated alignment during the development of cortical barrels and that CR may play an important role in the development of the paralemniscal pathway.

The Aβ-peptide is believed to be the major pathogenic compound of the disease. Since several years it is hypothesized that Aβ impacts the Wnt signaling cascade and therefore activation of this signaling pathway is proposed to rescue the neurotoxic effect of Aβ.FindingsExpression of the human Aβ42 in the Drosophila nervous system leads to a drastically shortened life span. We found that the action of Aβ42 specifically in the glutamatergic motoneurons is responsible for the reduced survival. However, we find that the morphology of the glutamatergic larval neuromuscular junctions, which are widely used as the model for mammalian central nervous system synapses, is not affected by Aβ42 expression. We furthermore demonstrate that genetic activation of the Wnt signal transduction pathway in the nervous system is not able to rescue the shortened life span or a rough eye phenotype in Drosophila.ConclusionsOur data confirm that the life span is a useful readout of Aβ42 induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila; the neuromuscular junction seems however not to be an appropriate model to study AD in flies.

In the nervous system, the core PCP signaling proteins have been identified to regulate neuronal maturation. In axonal growth cones, the antagonistic interaction of PCP components makes the tips of filopodia sensitive to guidance cues. However, the molecular mechanism by which the PCP signaling regulates spine and dendritic development remains obscure.FindingsHere we explored the finding that a loss of function of Vangl2 results in a significant reduction in spine density and complexity of dendritic branching. In spite of a previous report, in which the Vangl2 C-terminal TSV motif was shown to be required for the interaction with PSD-95 and the C-terminal intracellular domain was shown to associate with N-cadherin, overexpression of deletion mutants (Vangl2-ΔTSV and Vangl2-ΔC) had little effect on spine density. However, when an N-terminal region deletion mutant was overexpressed, spine density was slightly down-regulated. Intriguingly, the deletion mutants had a more potent effect on dendritic branching, such that the deletion of the N-terminal region reduced dendritic branching, whereas deletion of the C-terminal region increased it.ConclusionsBased on these results, Vangl2, a core PCP signaling pathway component, appears to have a functional role in neural complex formation.

Adenylyl cyclase-5 in the dorsal striatum function as a molecular switch for the generation of behavioral preferences for cue-directed food choices,"Hannah Kim1,, Tae-Kyung Kim1,, Ji-Eun Kim1,, Jin-Young Park1,, Yunjin Lee1,, Minkyung Kang1,, Kyoung-Shim Kim2 &, Pyung-Lim Han1,3,4",Pyung-Lim Han,plhan@ewha.ac.kr,2014-11-07,"BackgroundBehavioral choices in habits and innate behaviors occur automatically in the absence of conscious selection. These behaviors are not easily modified by learning. Similar types of behaviors also occur in various mental illnesses including drug addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. However, underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating unconditioned preferred behaviors in food-choices.ResultsMice lacking adenylyl cyclase-5 (AC5 KO mice), which is preferentially expressed in the dorsal striatum, consumed food pellets nearly one after another in cages. AC5 KO mice showed aversive behaviors to bitter tasting quinine, but they compulsively chose quinine-containing AC5 KO-pellets over fresh pellets. The unusual food-choice behaviors in AC5 KO mice were due to the gain of behavioral preferences for food pellets containing an olfactory cue, which wild-type mice normally ignored. Such food-choice behaviors in AC5 KO mice disappeared when whiskers were trimmed. Conversely, whisker trimming in wildtype mice induced behavioral preferences for AC5 KO food pellets, indicating that preferred food-choices were not learned through prior experience. Both AC5 KO mice and wildtype mice with trimmed whiskers had increased glutamatergic input from the barrel cortex into the dorsal striatum, resulting in an increase in the mGluR1-dependent signaling cascade. The siRNA-mediated inhibition of mGluR1 in the dorsal striatum in AC5 KO mice and wildtype mice with trimmed whiskers abolished preferred choices for AC5 KO food pellets, whereas siRNA-mediated inhibition of mGluR3 glutamate receptors in the dorsal striatum in wildtype mice induced behavioral preferences for AC5 KO food pellets, thus mimicking AC5 KO phenotypes.ConclusionsOur results show that the gain and loss of behavioral preferences for a specific cue-directed option were regulated by specific cellular factors in the dorsal striatum, such that the preferred food choices were switched on when either the mGluR3-AC5 pathway was inactive or the mGluR1 pathway was active, whereas the preferred food-choices were switched off when mGluR1 or its downstream pathway was suppressed.

To further examine the role of PI3Kβ in synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks we overexpressed p110β, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kβ, in the hippocampal CA1 region. We found that the overexpression of p110β impairs NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) task. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) and contextual fear memory were not affected by p110β overexpression.

This inhibition is regulated through a diverse network of neuromodulation. A number of recent studies suggest that one of the major regulators of interneuron function is nicotinic acetylcholinergic transmission and dysregulation of both systems is common in psychiatric conditions. However, how nicotinic modulation impacts specific subpopulations of diverse GABAergic interneurons remains in question. One potential way of conferring specificity to the convergence of GABAergic and nicotinic signaling is through the expression of a unique family of nicotinic acetycholine receptor modulators, the Lynx family. The present study sought to identify members of the Lynx family enriched in cortical interneurons and to elucidate subpopulations of GABAergic neurons that express unique nicotinic modulators.ResultsWe utilize double fluorescence in situ hybridization to examine the interneuronal expression of the Lynx family in adult mouse visual cortex. We find that two of the Lynx family members, Lynx1 and Lypd6, are enriched in interneuron populations in cortex. Nearly all parvalbumin interneurons express Lynx1 but we did not detect Lypd6 in this population. Conversely, in somatostatin interneurons Lypd6 was found in a subset localized to deep cortical layers but no somatostatin neurons show detectable levels of Lynx1. Using a combination of genetic and viral manipulations we further show that a subpopulation of deep-layer cortico-cortical long-range somatostatin neurons also express Lypd6.ConclusionsThis work shows that distinct subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons express unique Lynx family members. The pattern of expression of Lynx family members within interneurons places them in a unique position to potentially regulate the convergence of GABAergic and nicotinic systems, dysfunction of which are characteristic of psychiatric disorders.","GABA, Parvalbumin, Somatostatin, Lynx family, Lynx1, Lypd6, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, Visual cortex, Mouse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0075-9,2014

Sandy mice, with spontaneous Dtnbp1 deletion, display behavioral abnormalities relevant to symptoms of schizophrenia. However, it remains unknown if dysbindin-1 gain-of-function is beneficial or detrimental.ResultsTo answer this question and gain further insight into the pathophysiology and therapeutic potential of dysbindin-1, we developed transgenic mice expressing human DTNBP1 (Dys1A-Tg) and analyzed their behavioral phenotypes. Dys1A-Tg mice were born viable in the expected Mendelian ratios, apparently normal and fertile. Primary screening of behavior and function showed a marginal change in limb grasping in Dys1A-Tg mice. In addition, Dys1A-Tg mice exhibited increased hyperlocomotion after methamphetamine injection. Transcriptomic analysis identified several up- and down-regulated genes, including the immediate-early genes Arc and Egr2, in the prefrontal cortex of Dys1A-Tg mice.ConclusionsThe present findings in Dys1A-Tg mice support the role of dysbindin-1 in psychiatric disorders.

With its well-documented role in pain and emotion processing, the amygdala may act as a key player in pathogenesis of neuropathic pain-related anxiety. Pain-related plasticity and sensitization of CeA (central nucleus of the amygdala) neurons have been shown in several models of chronic pain. In addition, firing pattern of neurons with spike output can powerfully affect functional output of the brain nucleus, and GABAergic neurons are crucial in the modulation of neuronal excitability. In this study, we first investigated whether pain-related plasticity (e.g. alteration of neuronal firing patterns) and sensitization of CeA neurons contribute to nerve injury-evoked anxiety in neuropathic rats. Furthermore, we explored whether GABAergic disinhibition is responsible for regulating firing patterns and intrinsic excitabilities of CeA neurons as well as for pain-related anxiety in neuropathic rats.ResultsWe discovered that spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced neuropathic pain-related anxiety-like behaviors in rats, which could be specifically inhibited by intra-CeA administration of anti-anxiety drug diazepam. Moreover, we found potentiated plasticity and sensitization of CeA neurons in SNL-induced anxiety rats, of which including: 1) increased burst firing pattern and early-adapting firing pattern; 2) increased spike frequency and intrinsic excitability; 3) increased amplitude of both after-depolarized-potential (ADP) and sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation. In addition, we observed a remarkable reduction of GABAergic inhibition in CeA neurons in SNL-induced anxiety rats, which was proved to be important for altered firing patterns and hyperexcitability of CeA neurons, thereby greatly contributing to the development of neuropathic pain-related anxiety. Accordantly, activation of GABAergic inhibition by intra-CeA administration of muscimol, a selective GABAA receptors agonist, could inhibit SNL-induced anxiety-like behaviors in neuropathic rats. By contrast, suppression of GABAergic inhibition by intra-CeA administration of bicuculline, a selective GABAA receptors antagonist, produced anxiety-like behavior in normal rats.ConclusionsThis study suggests that reduction of GABAergic inhibition may be responsible for potentiated plasticity and sensitization of CeA neurons, which likely underlie the enhanced output of amygdala and neuropathic pain-related anxiety in SNL rats.","Anxiety, Neuropathic pain, Firing pattern, CeA, GABA",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0072-z,2014
Multiple microRNAs regulate human FOXP2 gene expression by targeting sequences in its 3' untranslated region,"Lijuan Fu1,, Zhimin Shi1,, Guanzheng Luo2,, Weihong Tu1,, XiuJie Wang2,, Zhide Fang3 &, XiaoChing Li1",XiaoChing Li,xli4@lsuhsc.edu,2014-10-01,"BackgroundMutations in the human FOXP2 gene cause speech and language impairments. The FOXP2 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many downstream genes, which may have important roles in nervous system development and function. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language. However, how FOXP2 gene expression is regulated is not clearly understood. The FOXP2 mRNA has an approximately 4-kb-long 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), twice as long as its protein coding region, indicating that FOXP2 can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs).FindingsWe identified multiple miRNAs that regulate the expression of the human FOXP2 gene using sequence analysis and in vitro cell systems. Focusing on let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p, three brain-enriched miRNAs, we show that these miRNAs regulate human FOXP2 expression in a dosage-dependent manner and target specific sequences in the FOXP2 3' UTR. We further show that these three miRNAs are expressed in the cerebellum of the human fetal brain, where FOXP2 is known to be expressed.ConclusionsOur results reveal novel regulatory functions of the human FOXP2 3' UTR sequence and regulatory interactions between multiple miRNAs and the human FOXP2 gene. The expression of let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p in the human fetal cerebellum is consistent with their roles in regulating FOXP2 expression during early cerebellum development.

Strikingly, MgT treatment was effective even when the treatment was given to the mice at the end-stage of their Alzheimer’s disease-like pathological progression. To explore how elevation of brain magnesium ameliorates the AD-like pathologies in the brain of transgenic mice, we studied molecules critical for APP metabolism and signaling pathways implicated in synaptic plasticity/density. In the transgenic mice, the NMDAR signaling pathway was downregulated, while the BACE1 expression were upregulated. MgT treatment prevented the impairment of these signaling pathways, stabilized BACE1 expression and reduced sAPPβ and β-CTF in the transgenic mice. At the molecular level, elevation of extracellular magnesium prevented the high Aβ-induced reductions in synaptic NMDARs by preventing calcineurin overactivation in hippocampal slices.ConclusionsOur results suggest that elevation of brain magnesium exerts substantial synaptoprotective effects in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and hence it might have therapeutic potential for treating Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease, Brain magnesium, Synaptoprotection, NMDAR signaling, BACE1",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0065-y,2014

Much less is known from animal studies regarding the factors and neural circuitry that affect paternal behavior compared with those affecting maternal behavior. We recently reported that ICR mouse sires displayed maternal-like retrieval behavior when they were separated from pups and caged with their mates (co-housing) because the sires receive communicative interactions via ultrasonic and pheromone signals from the dams. We investigated the brain structures involved in regulating this activity by quantifying c-Fos-immunoreactive cells as neuronal activation markers in the neural pathway of male parental behavior.Resultsc-Fos expression in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) was significantly higher in sires that exhibited retrieval behavior (retrievers) than those with no such behavior (non-retrievers). Identical increased expression was found in the mPOA region in the retrievers stimulated by ultrasonic vocalizations or pheromones from their mates. Such increases in expression were not observed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc) or ventral palladium (VP). On the following day that we identified the families of the retrievers or non-retrievers, c-Fos expression in neuronal subsets in the mPOA, VTA, NAcc and VP was much higher in the retriever sires when they isolated together with their mates in new cages.

Sevoflurane preconditioning ameliorates neuronal deficits by inhibiting microglial MMP-9 expression after spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion in rats,"Xiao-Qian Li1,, Xue-Zhao Cao1,, Jun Wang1,, Bo Fang1,, Wen-Fei Tan1 &, Hong Ma1",Hong Ma,mahong5466@yahoo.com,2014-09-04,"BackgroundMicroglia are the primary immune cells of the spinal cord that are activated in response to ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and release various neurotrophic and/or neurotoxic factors to determine neuronal survival. Among them, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which cleaves various components of the extracellular matrix in the basal lamina and functions as part of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB), is considered important for regulating inflammatory responses and microenvironmental homeostasis of the BSCB in the pathology of ischemia. Sevoflurane has been reported to protect against neuronal apoptosis during cerebral IR. However, the effects of sevoflurane preconditioning on spinal cord IR injury remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of sevoflurane on potential genetic roles of microglial MMP-9 in tight junction protein breakdown, opening of the BSCB, and subsequent recruitment of microglia to apoptotic spinal cord neurons.ResultsThe results showed significant upregulation of MMP-9 in rats with IR-induced inflammation of the BSCB compared to that of the sham group, manifested as dysfunctional BSCB with increased Evans blue extravasation and reduced expression of occludin protein. Increased MMP-9 expression was also observed to facilitate invasion and migration of activated microglia, imaging as high Iba-1 expression, clustered to neurons in the injured spinal cord, as shown by double immunofluorescence, and increased proinflammatory chemokine production (CXCL10, CCL2). Further, sevoflurane preconditioning markedly improved motor function by ameliorating neuronal apoptosis, as shown by reduced TUNEL-positive cell counts and expression of cleaved caspase-3. These protective effects were probably responsible for downregulation of MMP-9 and maintenance of normal expression of occludin protein indicating BSCB integrity from inflammatory damage, which was confirmed by decreased protein levels of Iba-1 and MMP-9, as well as reduced production of proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β). Intrathecal injection of specific siRNAs targeting MMP-9 had similar protective effects to those of sevoflurane preconditioning.ConclusionsPreconditioning with 2.4% sevoflurane attenuated spinal cord IR injury by inhibiting recruitment of microglia and secretion of MMP-9; thus inhibiting downstream effects on inflammatory damage to BSCB integrity and neuronal apoptosis.","Apoptosis, Blood spinal cord barrier, Matrix metalloproteinase, Microglia, Neuron, Spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0069-7,2014
Abnormalities in the zinc-metalloprotease-BDNF axis may contribute to megalencephaly and cortical hyperconnectivity in young autism spectrum disorder patients,"Jae-Young Koh1,2,, Joon Seo Lim1,, Hyae-Ran Byun1 &, Min-Heui Yoo1",Jae-Young Koh,jkko@amc.seoul.kr,2014-09-03,"Whereas aberrant brain connectivity is likely the core pathology of autism-spectrum disorder (ASD), studies do not agree as to whether hypo- or hyper-connectivity is the main underlying problem. Recent functional imaging studies have shown that, in most young ASD patients, cerebral cortical regions appear hyperconnected, and cortical thickness/brain size is increased. Collectively, these findings indicate that developing ASD brains may exist in an altered neurotrophic milieu. Consistently, some ASD patients, as well as some animal models of ASD, show increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, how BDNF is upregulated in ASD is unknown. To address this question, we propose the novel hypothesis that a putative zinc-metalloprotease-BDNF (ZMB) axis in the forebrain plays a pivotal role in the development of hyperconnectivity and megalencephaly in ASD.We have previously demonstrated that extracellular zinc at micromolar concentrations can rapidly increase BDNF levels and phosphorylate the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB via the activation of metalloproteases. The role of metalloproteases in ASD is still uncertain, but in fragile X syndrome, a monogenic disease with an autistic phenotype, the levels of MMP are increased. Early exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other MMP activators such as organic mercurials also have been implicated in ASD pathogenesis. The resultant increases in BDNF levels at synapses, especially those involved in the zinc-containing, associative glutamatergic system may produce abnormal brain circuit development. Various genetic mutations that lead to ASD are also known to affect BDNF signaling: some down-regulate, and others up-regulate it. We hypothesize that, although both up- and down-regulation of BDNF may induce autism symptoms, only BDNF up-regulation is associated with the hyperconnectivity and large brain size observed in most young idiopathic ASD patients.To test this hypothesis, we propose to examine the ZMB axis in animal models of ASD.

The pathogenetic process mediated by misfolded and/or aggregated mutant SOD1 polypeptides is hypothesized to be suppressed by protein refolding. This genetic study is aimed to test whether mutant SOD1-mediated ALS pathology recapitulated in mice could be alleviated by overexpressing a longevity-related deacetylase SIRT1 whose substrates include a transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of the chaperone system.ResultsWe established a line of transgenic mice that chronically overexpress SIRT1 in the brain and spinal cord. While inducible HSP70 (HSP70i) was upregulated in the spinal cord of SIRT1 transgenic mice (PrP-Sirt1), no neurological and behavioral alterations were detected. To test hypothetical benefits of SIRT1 overexpression, we crossbred PrP-Sirt1 mice with two lines of ALS model mice: A high expression line that exhibits a severe phenotype (SOD1G93A-H) or a low expression line with a milder phenotype (SOD1G93A-L). The Sirt1 transgene conferred longer lifespan without altering the time of symptomatic onset in SOD1G93A-L. Biochemical analysis of the spinal cord revealed that SIRT1 induced HSP70i expression through deacetylation of HSF1 and that SOD1G93A-L/PrP-Sirt1 double transgenic mice contained less insoluble SOD1 than SOD1G93A-L mice. Parallel experiments showed that Sirt1 transgene could not rescue a more severe phenotype of SOD1G93A-H transgenic mice partly because their HSP70i level had peaked out.ConclusionsThe genetic supplementation of SIRT1 can ameliorate a mutant SOD1-linked ALS mouse model partly through the activation of the HSF1/HSP70i chaperone system. Future studies shall include testing potential benefits of pharmacological enhancement of the deacetylation activity of SIRT1 after the onset of the symptom.","Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), Heat shock protein (HSP), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Systematic behavioral screening",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0062-1,2014
Neuronal representation of working memory in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats,"Sheng-Tao Yang1,, Yi Shi1,, Qi Wang1,, Ji-Yun Peng1 &, Bao-Ming Li1,2",Bao-Ming Li,bmli@ncu.edu.cn,2014-08-28,"Working memory is a process for short-term active maintenance of information. Behavioral neurophysiological studies in monkeys have demonstrated that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is a key cortical region for working memory. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats is a cortical area similar to the dlPFC in monkeys in terms of anatomical connections, and is also required for behavioral performance on working-memory tasks. However, it is still controversial regarding whether and how mPFC neurons encode working memory. In the present study, we trained rats on a two-choice spatial delayed alternation task in Y maze, a typical working memory task for rodents, and investigated neuronal activities in the mPFC when rats performed the task. Our results show that, (1) inactivation of the mPFC severely impaired the performance of rats on the task, consistent with previous studies showing the importance of the mPFC for working-memory tasks; (2) 93.7% mPFC cells (449 in 479) exhibited changes in spiking frequency that were temporally locked with the task events, some of which, including delay-related cells, were tuned by spatial information; (3) differential delay activities in individual mPFC cells appeared transiently and sequentially along the delay, especially during the early phase of the delay; (4) some mPFC cells showed no change in discharge frequency but exhibited differential synchronization in firing during the delay. The present results suggest that mPFC neurons in rats are involved in encoding working memory, via increasing firing frequency or synchronization.","Neuron activity, Medial prefrontal cortex, Working memory, Rats",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0061-2,2014

Furthermore, it is well admitted that inflammation contributes to the progression of these diseases. Interestingly, crosstalks between autophagy and inflammation have been reported in vitro and at the peripheral level such as in Crohn's disease. However, the impact of systemic inflammation on autophagic components in the brain remains to be documented. Therefore, this study monitored autophagy markers after acute and chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory stress in mice.ResultsWe showed that acute inflammation, 24 h post-intraperitoneal 10 mg/kg LPS, substantially increased cytokine production (Interleukin(IL)-1β , Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α and IL-6), decreased the levels of autophagy markers (Beclin-1, p62 and LC3 II) and reduced p70S6K activation in cortex and hippocampus. In hippocampus, IL-1β levels and LC3 II expression were positively and highly correlated and a negative correlation was noted between TNF-β levels and p70S6K activation. Chronic inflammation by injection of 0.5 mg/kg LPS every three days during three months led to a moderate IL-1β production and decreased TNF-α levels. Interestingly, Beclin-1 and LC3 II levels decreased while those of p62 increased. Cortical IL-1β levels positively correlated with Beclin-1 and LC3 II and on the contrary inversely correlated with p62.ConclusionThe present study is the first showing links between IL-1β-mediated inflammation and autophagy in the brain. It could open to new therapeutic strategies in brain diseases where regulation impairment of inflammation and autophagy progress with the severity of diseases.","Inflammation, Autophagy, IL-1β, Brain, Mouse, Lipopolysaccharide",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0056-z,2014

However, the possible function of sensory neuron TLR4 has not yet been formally addressed. In this regard, we investigated the role of TLR4 in itch signal transmission.ResultsTLR4 was expressed on a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons that express TRPV1. In TLR4-knockout mice, histamine-induced itch responses were compromised while TLR4 activation by LPS did not directly elicit an itch response. Histamine-induced intracellular calcium signals and inward currents were comparably reduced in TLR4-deficient sensory neurons. Reduced histamine sensitivity in the TLR4-deficient neurons was accompanied by a decrease in TRPV1 activity. Heterologous expression experiments in HEK293T cells indicated that TLR4 expression enhanced capsaicin-induced intracellular calcium signals and inward currents.ConclusionsOur data show that TLR4 on sensory neurons enhances histamine-induced itch signal transduction by potentiating TRPV1 activity.

To address this issue, we have simultaneously imaged morphology and ER content of dendritic spines in cultured dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons. Over a 10 min period, spines were highly dynamic, with spines both increasing and decreasing in volume. ER was present in approximately 50% of spines and was also highly dynamic, with a net increase over this period of time. Inhibition of the endogenous activation of NMDA receptors resulted in a reduction in ER growth. Conversely, augmentation of the synaptic activation of NMDA receptors, by elimination of striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP), resulted in enhanced ER growth.

Among environmental factors, social experience plays an important role in modulating aggression in vertebrates and invertebrates. In Drosophila, pheromonal activation of olfactory neurons contributes to social suppression of aggression. While it was reported that impairment in vision decreases the level of aggression in Drosophila, it remains unknown if visual perception also contributes to the modulation of aggression by social experience.ResultsIn this study, we investigate the role of visual perception in the control of aggression in Drosophila. We took several genetic approaches to examine the effects of blocking visual circuit activity on fly aggressive behaviors. In wild type, group housing greatly suppresses aggressiveness. Loss of vision by mutating the ninaB gene does not affect social suppression of fly aggression. Similar suppression of aggressiveness by group housing is observed in fly mutants carrying a mutation in the eya gene leading to complete loss of eye. Chronic visual loss does not affect the level of aggressiveness of single-housed flies that lack social experience prior to behavioral tests. When visual circuit activity is acutely blocked during behavioral test, however, single-housed flies display higher levels of aggressiveness than that of control flies.ConclusionVisual perception does not play a major role in social suppression of aggression in Drosophila.

Recently, synaptic plasticity has been observed in the adult central nervous system, including the outer retinal layers. However, few studies have focused on changes in the synapses between RGCs and bipolar cells in glaucoma. In the present study, we used a rat model of ocular hypertension induced by episcleral vein cauterization to investigate changes in synaptic structure and protein expression in the inner retinal layer at various time points after moderate intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation.ResultsSynaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle protein, increased throughout the IPL, outer plexiform layer, and outer nuclear layer after IOP elevation. Increased synaptophysin after IOP elevation was expressed in bipolar cells in the innermost IPL. The RGC marker, SMI-32, co-localized with synaptophysin in RGC dendrites and were significantly increased at 1 week and 4 weeks after IOP elevation. Both synaptophysin and postsynaptic vesicle protein, PSD-95, were increased after IOP elevation by western blot analysis. Ribbon synapses in the IPL were quantified and structurally evaluated in retinal sections by transmission electron microscopy. After IOP elevation the total number of ribbon synapses decreased. There were increases in synapse diameter and synaptic vesicle number and decreases in active zone length and the number of docked vesicles after IOP elevation.ConclusionsAlthough the total number of synapses decreased as RGCs were lost after IOP elevation, there are attempts to increase synaptic vesicle proteins and immature synapse formation between RGCs and bipolar cells in the inner retinal layers after glaucoma induction.","Retinal ganglion cell, Glaucoma, Synapse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0053-2,2014

Dopaminergic specification in the embryonic ventral midbrain (VM) coincides with increased HA brain levels. To study the effect of HA receptor stimulation on dopamine neuron generation, we administered HA to dopamine progenitors, both in vitro and in vivo.ResultsCultured embryonic day 12 (E12) VM neural stem/progenitor cells expressed transcripts for HA receptors H1R, H2R and H3R. These undifferentiated progenitors increased intracellular calcium upon HA addition. In HA-treated cultures, dopamine neurons significantly decreased after activation of H1R. We performed intrauterine injections in the developing VM to investigate HA effects in vivo. HA administration to E12 rat embryos notably reduced VM Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) staining 2 days later, without affecting GABA neurons in the midbrain, or serotonin neurons in the mid-hindbrain boundary. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that several markers important for the generation and maintenance of dopaminergic lineage such as TH, Lmx1a and Lmx1b were significantly diminished. To identify the cell type susceptible to HA action, we injected embryos of different developmental stages, and found that neural progenitors (E10 and E12) were responsive, whereas differentiated dopaminergic neurons (E14 and E16) were not susceptible to HA actions. Proliferation was significantly diminished, whereas neuronal death was not increased in the VM after HA administration. We injected H1R or H2R antagonists to identify the receptor responsible for the detrimental effect of HA on dopaminergic lineage and found that activation of H1R was required.ConclusionThese results reveal a novel action of HA affecting dopaminergic lineage during VM development.","Neural stem cells, Midbrain development, Dopaminergic neurons, Ultrasound injections, Parkinson’s disease",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0058-x,2014

Mitochondrial malfunction is implicated in PD pathogenesis. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a serine/threonine kinase, plays an important role in the quality control of mitochondria and more than 70 PINK1 mutations have been identified to cause early-onset PD. However, the regulation of PINK1 gene expression remains elusive. In the present study, we identified the transcription start site (TSS) of the human PINK1 gene using switching mechanism at 5’end of RNA transcription (SMART RACE) assay.

Four functional cis-acting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB)-binding sites within the PINK1 promoter were identified. NFκB overexpression led to the up-regulation of PINK1 expression in both HEK293 cells and SH-SY5Y cells. Consistently, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a strong activator of NFκB, significantly increased PINK1 expression in SH-SY5Y cells.

The Amyloid Precursor Protein is rapidly transported from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome and where it is processed into beta-amyloid,"Joshua HK Tam1,3,, Claudia Seah1 &, Stephen H Pasternak1,2,3",Stephen H Pasternak,spasternak@robarts.ca,2014-08-01,"BackgroundAlzheimer s disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral deposition of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Aβ is produced by sequential cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. Many studies have demonstrated that the internalization of APP from the cell surface can regulate Aβ production, although the exact organelle in which Aβ is produced remains contentious. A number of recent studies suggest that intracellular trafficking also plays a role in regulating Aβ production, but these pathways are relatively under-studied. The goal of this study was to elucidate the intracellular trafficking of APP, and to examine the site of intracellular APP processing.ResultsWe have tagged APP on its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail with photoactivatable Green Fluorescent Protein (paGFP). By photoactivating APP-paGFP in the Golgi, using the Golgi marker Galactosyltranferase fused to Cyan Fluorescent Protein (GalT-CFP) as a target, we are able to follow a population of nascent APP molecules from the Golgi to downstream compartments identified with compartment markers tagged with red fluorescent protein (mRFP or mCherry); including rab5 (early endosomes) rab9 (late endosomes) and LAMP1 (lysosomes). Because γ-cleavage of APP releases the cytoplasmic tail of APP including the photoactivated GFP, resulting in loss of fluorescence, we are able to visualize the cleavage of APP in these compartments. Using APP-paGFP, we show that APP is rapidly trafficked from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome; where it is rapidly cleared. Chloroquine and the highly selective γ-secretase inhibitor, L685, 458, cause the accumulation of APP in lysosomes implying that APP is being cleaved by secretases in the lysosome. The Swedish mutation dramatically increases the rate of lysosomal APP processing, which is also inhibited by chloroquine and L685, 458. By knocking down adaptor protein 3 (AP-3; a heterotetrameric protein complex required for trafficking many proteins to the lysosome) using siRNA, we are able to reduce this lysosomal transport. Blocking lysosomal transport of APP reduces Aβ production by more than a third.ConclusionThese data suggests that AP-3 mediates rapid delivery of APP to lysosomes, and that the lysosome is a likely site of Aβ production.","Lysosome, Live cell imaging, Confocal microscopy, Amyloid Precursor Protein, Trafficking, Beta amyloid production, Gamma-secretase",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0054-1,2014

Thus, alternative methods of gene manipulations to address important biological questions are highly desirable. In this study, we utilized in utero electroporation technique which involves efficient delivery of hindbrain-specific enhancer/promoter construct, Krox20 into the third ventricle of live mouse embryo to investigate green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression pattern in mouse auditory brainstem and other hindbrain neurons.ResultsWe created a GFP/DNA construct containing a Krox20 B enhancer and β-globin promoter to drive GFP expression in the hindbrain via injection into the third ventricle of E12 to E13.5 mice. Electrical currents were applied directly to the embryonic hindbrain to allow DNA uptake into the cell. Confocal images were then acquired from fixed brain slices to analyze GFP expression in mouse whole brain at different postnatal stages (P6-P21). By using a cell-type specific enhancer as well as region specific injection and electroporation, robust GFP expression in the cerebellum and auditory brainstem but not in the forebrain was observed. GFP expression in calyx of Held terminals was more robust in <P15 compared to >P15 mice. In contrast, GFP expression in MNTB neurons was more prevalent in >P15 compared to <P15. In regards to the relative expression of GFP versus the synaptic marker Vglut1, percentage fluorescence GFP intensity in the calyx was higher in P11 to P15 than P6 to P10 and P16 to P21 groups.ConclusionsTaken together, this technique would potentially allow hindbrain-specific genetic manipulations such as knock-down, knock-in and rescue experiments to unravel critical molecular substrates underpinning functional and morphological remodeling of synapses as well as understanding the pathophysiology of certain neurological disorders targeting not only the auditory brainstem but also other parts of hindbrain, most notably the cerebellum.","In utero electroporation, Gene delivery, Krox20, Hindbrain, Calyx of Held, MNTB, GFP",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-014-0051-4,2014

However, no effective therapy has been established to date. Although genetic mutations have been identified, the available clinical data are not always sufficient to elucidate the roles of these mutations in disease pathogenesis, a situation that is partially due to differences in genetic backgrounds.ResultsWe generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an RP patient carrying a rhodopsin mutation (E181K). Using helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAdV) gene transfer, the mutation was corrected in the patient’s iPSCs and also introduced into control iPSCs. The cells were then subjected to retinal differentiation; the resulting rod photoreceptor cells were labeled with an Nrl promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-carrying adenovirus and purified using flow cytometry after 5 weeks of culture. Using this approach, we found a reduced survival rate in the photoreceptor cells with the E181K mutation, which was correlated with the increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptotic markers. The screening of therapeutic reagents showed that rapamycin, PP242, AICAR, NQDI-1, and salubrinal promoted the survival of the patient’s iPSC-derived photoreceptor cells, with a concomitant reduction in markers of ER stress and apoptosis. Additionally, autophagy markers were found to be correlated with ER stress, suggesting that autophagy was reduced by suppressing ER stress-induced apoptotic changes.ConclusionThe use of RP patient-derived iPSCs combined with genome editing provided a versatile cellular system with which to define the roles of genetic mutations in isogenic iPSCs with or without mutation and also provided a system that can be used to explore candidate therapeutic approaches.","iPS cells, Retina, Neurodegeneration, Gene delivery, Drug screening, ER stress",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-45,2014

In this study, we used a brain-region specific knock-in mouse expressing an NMDA receptor that is defective for the Mg2+ block in order to test its role in neural information processing.ResultsWe devised a method to induce a single amino acid substitution (N595Q) in the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor, specifically in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in mice.

In most cases, manipulating a gene expressed in the brain impairs cognitive functions such as memory and their underlying cellular mechanisms, including synaptic plasticity. However, a remarkable number of mutations have been shown to enhance memory in mice. Understanding how to improve a system provides valuable insights into how the system works under normal conditions, because this involves understanding what the crucial components are. Therefore, more can be learned about the basic mechanisms of memory by studying mutant mice with enhanced memory. This review will summarize the genes and signaling pathways that are altered in the mutants with enhanced memory, as well as their roles in synaptic plasticity.

Inorganic polyphosphate regulates neuronal excitability through modulation of voltage-gated channels,"Stephanie C Stotz1,, Lucas OM Scott1,, Christopher Drummond-Main2,, Yosef Avchalumov1,, Fernando Girotto3,, Jörn Davidsen3,, Maria R Gómez-Gárcia4,, Jong M Rho2,, Evgeny V Pavlov5 &, Michael A Colicos1",Michael A Colicos,mcolicos@ucalgary.ca,2014-05-31,"BackgroundInorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a highly charged polyanion capable of interacting with a number of molecular targets. This signaling molecule is released into the extracellular matrix by central astrocytes and by peripheral platelets during inflammation. While the release of polyP is associated with both induction of blood coagulation and astrocyte extracellular signaling, the role of secreted polyP in regulation of neuronal activity remains undefined. Here we test the hypothesis that polyP is an important participant in neuronal signaling. Specifically, we investigate the ability of neurons to release polyP and to induce neuronal firing, and clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process by studying the action of polyP on voltage gated channels.ResultsUsing patch clamp techniques, and primary hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion cell cultures, we demonstrate that polyP directly influences neuronal activity, inducing action potential generation in both PNS and CNS neurons. Mechanistically, this is accomplished by shifting the voltage sensitivity of NaV channel activation toward the neuronal resting membrane potential, the block KV channels, and the activation of CaV channels. Next, using calcium imaging we found that polyP stimulates an increase in neuronal network activity and induces calcium influx in glial cells. Using in situ DAPI localization and live imaging, we demonstrate that polyP is naturally present in synaptic regions and is released from the neurons upon depolarization. Finally, using a biochemical assay we demonstrate that polyP is present in synaptosomes and can be released upon their membrane depolarization by the addition of potassium chloride.ConclusionsWe conclude that polyP release leads to increased excitability of the neuronal membrane through the modulation of voltage gated ion channels. Together, our data establishes that polyP could function as excitatory neuromodulator in both the PNS and CNS.","Polyphosphate, Voltage gated channels, Neuroactive compounds, Synaptic vesicles, Synaptic transmission, Neuronal activity, Pain, Platelets, Inflammation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-42,2014

GABA can induce “phasic” or “tonic” inhibition in neurons through synaptic or extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, respectively. However, role of the thalamic “tonic GABA inhibition” in cognition has not been explored. We addressed this issue in extinction of conditioned fear in mice.ResultsHere, we show that GABAA receptors in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) modulate fear extinction. Microinjection of gabazine, a GABAA receptor antagonist, into the MD decreased freezing behavior in response to the conditioned stimulus and thus facilitated fear extinction. Interestingly, microinjection of THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol), a preferential agonist for the δ-subunit of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, into the MD attenuated fear extinction. In the opposite direction, an MD-specific knock-out of the extrasynaptic GABAA receptors facilitated fear extinction.ConclusionsOur results suggest that “tonic GABA inhibition” mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in MD neurons, suppresses fear extinction learning.

The exact mechanisms underlying this disorder remain unknown, though theories abound. Recent studies suggest that particular cell types and biological processes in the schizophrenic cortex have a pseudo-immature status in which the molecular properties partially resemble those in the normal immature brain. However, genome-wide gene expression patterns in the brains of patients with schizophrenia and those of normal infants have not been directly compared. Here, we show that the gene expression patterns in the schizophrenic prefrontal cortex (PFC) resemble those in the juvenile PFC.ResultsWe conducted a gene expression meta-analysis in which, using microarray data derived from different studies, altered expression patterns in the dorsolateral PFC (DLFC) of patients with schizophrenia were compared with those in the DLFC of developing normal human brains, revealing a striking similarity. The results were replicated in a second DLFC data set and a medial PFC (MFC) data set. We also found that about half of the genes representing the transcriptomic immaturity of the schizophrenic PFC were developmentally regulated in fast-spiking interneurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, to test whether medications, which often confound the results of postmortem analyses, affect on the juvenile-like gene expressions in the schizophrenic PFC, we compared the gene expression patterns showing transcriptomic immaturity in the schizophrenic PFC with those in the PFC of rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs. The results showed no apparent similarities between the two conditions, suggesting that the juvenile-like gene expression patterns observed in the schizophrenic PFC could not be accounted for by medication effects. Moreover, the developing human PFC showed a gene expression pattern similar to that of the PFC of naive Schnurri-2 knockout mice, an animal model of schizophrenia with good face and construct validity. This result also supports the idea that the transcriptomic immaturity of the schizophrenic PFC is not due to medication effects.ConclusionsCollectively, our results provide evidence that pseudo-immaturity of the PFC resembling juvenile PFC may be an endophenotype of schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia, Transcriptome, Prefrontal cortex, Immaturity, Parvalbumin, Endophenotype",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-41,2014

We investigated the roles of sodium channels in AISS induction and expression at hippocampal GABAergic neurons by electrophysiological approach.ResultsAISS expression includes additional spike capability above evoked spikes, and the full spikes in AISS comprise early phase (spikelets) and late phase, implying the emergence of new spikelet component. Compared with the late phase, the early phase is characterized as voltage-independent onset, less voltage-dependent upstroke and sensitivity to TTX. AISS expression and induction are independent of membrane potential changes. Therefore, AISS’s spikelets express based on voltage-independent sodium channels. In terms of AISS induction, the facilitation of voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation accelerates AISS onset, or vice versa.ConclusionAISS expression in GABAergic neurons is triggered by the spikelets based on the functional emergence of voltage-independent sodium channels, which is driven by intensive VGSCs’ activities.","Action potential, Spontaneous spikes, Threshold potential, Sodium channel, Hippocampus, GABAergic neurons",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-38,2014
Vorinostat positively regulates synaptic plasticity genes expression and spine density in HIV infected neurons: role of nicotine in progression of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder,"Venkata Subba Rao Atluri1,, Sudheesh Pilakka-Kanthikeel1,, Thangavel Samikkannu1,, Vidya Sagar1,, Kesava Rao Venkata Kurapati1,, Shailendra K Saxena2,, Adriana Yndart1,, Andrea Raymond1,, Hong Ding1,, Oscar Hernandez1 &, Madhavan PN Nair1",Madhavan PN Nair,nairm@fiu.edu,2014-05-15,"BackgroundHIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is characterized by development of cognitive, behavioral and motor abnormalities, and occurs in approximately 50% of HIV infected individuals. In the United States, the prevalence of cigarette smoking ranges from 35-70% in HIV-infected individuals compared to 20% in general population. Cognitive impairment in heavy cigarette smokers has been well reported. However, the synergistic effects of nicotine and HIV infection and the underlying mechanisms in the development of HAND are unknown.ResultsIn this study, we explored the role of nicotine in the progression of HAND using SK-N-MC, a neuronal cell line. SK-N-MC cells were infected with HIV-1 in the presence or absence of nicotine for 7 days. We observed significant increase in HIV infectivity in SK-N-MC treated with nicotine compared to untreated HIV-infected neuronal cells. HIV and nicotine synergize to significantly dysregulate the expression of synaptic plasticity genes and spine density; with a concomitant increase of HDAC2 levels in SK-N-MC cells. In addition, inhibition of HDAC2 up-regulation with the use of vorinostat resulted in HIV latency breakdown and recovery of synaptic plasticity genes expression and spine density in nicotine/HIV alone and in co-treated SK-N-MC cells. Furthermore, increased eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, which negatively regulates eukaryotic translational process, was observed in HIV alone and in co-treatment with nicotine compared to untreated control and nicotine alone treated SK-N-MC cells.ConclusionsThese results suggest that nicotine and HIV synergize to negatively regulate the synaptic plasticity gene expression and spine density and this may contribute to the increased risk of HAND in HIV infected smokers. Apart from disrupting latency, vorinostat may be a useful therapeutic to inhibit the negative regulatory effects on synaptic plasticity in HIV infected nicotine abusers.","Human synaptic plasticity, PCR array, Spine density, HIV, Nicotine, HDAC2, eIF2α, Vorinostat, SK-N-MC neuronal cells, Neurocognitive disorder",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-37,2014
Block of T-type calcium channels by protoxins I and II,"Chris Bladen1,, Jawed Hamid1,, Ivana A Souza1 &, Gerald W Zamponi1",Gerald W Zamponi,zamponi@ucalgary.ca,2014-05-09,"BackgroundLow-voltage-activated (T-type) calcium channels play a crucial role in a number of physiological processes, including neuronal and cardiac pacemaker activity and nociception. Therefore, finding specific modulators and/or blockers of T-type channels has become an important field of drug discovery. One characteristic of T-type calcium channels is that they share several structural similarities with voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). We therefore hypothesized that binding sites for certain sodium channel blocking peptide toxins may be present in T-type calcium channels.FindingsThe sodium channel blocker ProTx I tonically blocked native and transiently expressed T-type channels in the sub- to low micro molar range with at least a ten-fold selectivity for the T-type calcium channel hCav3.1 over hCav3.3, and more than one hundred fold selectivity over hCav3.2. Using chimeras of hCav3.1 and hCav3.3, we determined that the domain IV region of hCav3.1 is a major determinant of toxin affinity, with a minor contribution from domain II. Further analysis revealed several residues in a highly conserved region between T-type and sodium channels that may correspond to toxin binding sites. Mutagenesis of several of these residues on an individual basis, however, did not alter the blocking effects of the toxin. ProTx II on the other hand preferentially blocked hCav3.2 and significantly shifted the steady state inactivation of this channel.ConclusionsProTx I blocks hCav3.1 both selectively and with high affinity. Domain IV appears to play a major role in this selectivity with some contribution from domain II.

Analysis of rare variations reveals roles of amino acid residues in the N-terminal extracellular domain of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha6 subunit in the functional expression of human alpha6*-nAChRs,"Bhagirathi Dash1 &, Ming D Li1",Ming D Li,ml2km@virginia.edu,2014-05-02,"BackgroundFunctional heterologous expression of naturally-expressed and apparently functional mammalian α6*-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; where ‘*’ indicates presence of additional subunits) has been difficult. Here we wanted to investigate the role of N-terminal domain (NTD) residues of human (h) nAChR α6 subunit in the functional expression of hα6*-nAChRs. To this end, instead of adopting random mutagenesis as a tool, we used 15 NTD rare variations (i.e., Ser43Pro, Asn46Lys, Asp57Asn, Arg87Cys, Asp92Glu, Arg96His, Glu101Lys, Ala112Val, Ser156Arg, Asn171Lys, Ala184Asp, Asp199Tyr, Asn203Thr, Ile226Thr and Ser233Cys) in nAChR hα6 subunit to probe for their effect on the functional expression of hα6*-nAChRs.ResultsN-terminal α-helix (Asp57); complementary face/inner β-fold (Arg87 or Asp92) and principal face/outer β-fold (Ser156 or Asn171) residues in the hα6 subunit are crucial for functional expression of the hα6*-nAChRs as variations in these residues reduce or abrogate the function of hα6hβ2*-, hα6hβ4- and hα6hβ4hβ3-nAChRs. While variations at residues Ser43 or Asn46 (both in N-terminal α-helix) in hα6 subunit reduce hα6hβ2*-nAChRs function those at residues Arg96 (β2-β3 loop), Asp199 (loop F) or Ser233 (β10-strand) increase hα6hβ2*-nAChR function. Similarly substitution of NTD α-helix (Asn46), loop F (Asp199), loop A (Ala112), loop B (Ala184), or loop C (Ile226) residues in hα6 subunit increase the function of hα6hβ4-nAChRs. All other variations in hα6 subunit do not affect the function of hα6hβ2*- and hα6hβ4*-nAChRs. Incorporation of nAChR hβ3 subunits always increase the function of wild-type or variant hα6hβ4-nAChRs except for those of hα6(D57N, S156R, R87C or N171K)hβ4-nAChRs. It appears Asp57Lys, Ser156Arg or Asn171Lys variations in hα6 subunit drive the hα6hβ4hβ3-nAChRs into a nonfunctional state as at spontaneously open hα6(D57N, S156R or N171K)hβ4hβ3V9’S-nAChRs (V9’S; transmembrane II 9’ valine-to-serine mutation) agonists act as antagonists. Agonist sensitivity of hα6hβ4- and/or hα6hβ4hβ3-nAChRs is nominally increased due to Arg96His, Ala184Asp, Asp199Tyr or Ser233Cys variation in hα6 subunit.ConclusionsHence investigating functional consequences of natural variations in nAChR hα6 subunit we have discovered additional bases for cell surface functional expression of various subtypes of hα6*-nAChRs. Variations (Asp57Asn, Arg87Cys, Asp92Glu, Ser156Arg or Asn171Lys) in hα6 subunit that compromise hα6*-nAChR function are expected to contribute to individual differences in responses to smoked nicotine.","Electrophysiology, Ion channels, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, Receptor structure-function, Single nucleotide variation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-35,2014
Effect of the Brugada syndrome mutation A39V on calmodulin regulation of Cav1.2 channels,"Brett A Simms1,, Ivana Assis Souza1 &, Gerald W Zamponi1",Gerald W Zamponi,Zamponi@ucalgary.ca,2014-04-28,"BackgroundThe L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 is important for brain and heart function. The ubiquitous calcium sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) regulates calcium dependent gating of Cav1.2 channels by reducing calcium influx, a process known as calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI). Dissecting the calcium-dependence of CaM in this process has benefited greatly from the use of mutant CaM molecules which are unable to bind calcium to their low affinity (N-lobe) and high affinity (C-lobe) binding sites. Unlike CDI, it is unknown whether CaM can modulate the activation gating of Cav1.2 channels.ResultsWe examined a Cav1.2 point mutant in the N-terminus region of the channel (A39V) that has been previously linked to Brugada syndrome. Using mutant CaM constructs in which the N- and/or C-lobe calcium binding sites were ablated, we were able to show that this Brugada syndrome mutation disrupts N-lobe CDI of the channel. In the course of these experiments, we discovered that all mutant CaM molecules were able to alter the kinetics of channel activation even in the absence of calcium for WT-Cav1.2, but not A39V-Cav1.2 channels. Moreover, CaM mutants differentially shifted the voltage-dependence of activation for WT and A39V-Cav1.2 channels to hyperpolarized potentials. Our data therefore suggest that structural changes in CaM that arise directly from site directed mutagenesis of calcium binding domains alter activation gating of Cav1.2 channels independently of their effects on calcium binding, and that the N-terminus of the channel contributes to this CaM dependent process.ConclusionsOur data indicate that caution must be exercised when interpreting the effects of CaM mutants on ion channel gating.","Calcium channel, Calmodulin mutant, CDI, N-terminus, Brugada, Activation, Cav1.2, L-type, IQ, Channelopathy, Voltage, Gating, CACNA1C",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-34,2014
Chronic brain inflammation causes a reduction in GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors and an increase in the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in the hippocampus,"Jinhua Ma1,, Bo-Ryoung Choi1,, ChiHye Chung1,, Sun Seek Min2,, Won Kyung Jeon3 &, Jung-Soo Han1",Jung-Soo Han,jshan06@konkuk.ac.kr,2014-04-24,"Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the initiation and progression of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Chronic neuroinflammation results in diminished synaptic plasticity and loss of GluN1 N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus, leading to the cognitive deficits that are the most common symptoms of AD. Therefore, it is suggested that chronic inflammation may alter expression levels of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors and associated intracellular signalling. Chronic neuroinflammation was induced by chronic infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the fourth ventricle in Fischer-344 rats. The status of hippocampus-dependent memory was evaluated in control rats and rats chronically infused with LPS. Microglial activation in the hippocampus was examined using immunohistochemical staining. Western blot analysis was used to measure membrane levels of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the hippocampi of these rats, and immunofluorescent double labeling was used to assess the cellular location of MAPK. Microglial activation was observed in the hippocampi of rats that showed memory impairments with chronic LPS infusion. Chronic LPS infusion reduced the levels of GluN2A and GluN2B and increased the levels of phosphorylated MAPKs in the hippocampus. MAPK-positive immunoreactivity was observed mostly in the neurons and also in non-neuronal cells. Reductions in GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors coupled with altered MAPK signaling, in response to inflammatory stimuli may be related to the cognitive deficits observed in AD.","Neuroinflammation, Memory, NMDA, MAPK, Microglia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-33,2014

GABA receptor A (GABAAR) mediates the primary component of inhibition in brain and its activation produces two forms of inhibition: the phasic and tonic inhibition. While both of them are critically engaged in limiting the activity of amygdala, their roles in the amygdala disinhibition subsequent to chronic stress exposure are largely unknown.ResultsWe investigated the possible alterations of phasic and tonic GABAAR currents and their roles in the amygdala disinhibition subsequent to chronic stress. We found that both chronic immobilization and unpredictable stress led to long lasting loss of tonic GABAAR currents in the projection neurons of lateral amygdala. By contrast, the phasic GABAAR currents, as measured by the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, were virtually unaltered. The loss of tonic inhibition varied with the duration of daily stress and the total days of stress exposure. It was prevented by pretreatment with metyrapone to block corticosterone synthesis or RU 38486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, suggesting the critical involvement of glucocorticoid receptor activation. Moreover, chronic treatment with corticosterone mimicked the effect of chronic stress and reduced the tonic inhibition in lateral amygdala of control mice. The loss of tonic inhibition resulted in the impaired GABAergic gating on neuronal excitability in amygdala, which was prevented by metyrapone pretreatment.ConclusionsOur study suggests that enduring loss of tonic but not phasic GABAAR currents critically contributes to the prolonged amygdala disinhibition subsequent to chronic stress. We propose that the preferential loss of tonic inhibition may account for the development of stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases.","Amygdala, Chronic stress, GABA, Electrophysiology, Tonic inhibition, Corticosterone, Glucocorticoid receptor, Neuronal excitability",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-32,2014

Physiological roles of GRM3 in brain functions and its functional roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain to be resolved.ResultsWe generated mGluR3 knockout (KO) mice and conducted comprehensive behavioral analyses. KO mice showed hyperactivity in the open field, light/dark transition, and 24-hour home cage monitoring tests, impaired reference memory for stressful events in the Porsolt forced swim test, impaired contextual memory in cued and contextual fear conditioning test, and impaired working memory in the T-Maze forced alternation task test. Hyperactivity and impaired working memory are known as endophenotypes of schizophrenia. We examined long-term synaptic plasticity by assessing long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region in the hippocampi of KO and wild-type (WT) mice. We observed no differences in the amplitude of LTP between the two genotypes, suggesting that mGluR3 is not essential for LTP in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. As hyperactivity is typically associated with increased dopaminergic transmission, we performed in vivo microdialysis measurements of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of KO and WT mice. We observed enhancements in the methamphetamine (MAP)-induced release of dopamine in KO mice.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that a disturbance in the glutamate-dopamine interaction may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia-like behavior, such as hyperactivity in mGluR3 KO mice.","Metabotropic glutamate receptors, Grm3, Knockout mice, Working memory, Reference memory, Contextual memory, Hyperactivity, LTP, Microdialysis, Schizophrenia",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-31,2014

Arc (also known as Arg3.1) is implicated in synaptic and experience-dependent plasticity. Arc is regulated by the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein, which is upregulated with and necessary for fear extinction. Because Arc expression is also activated with fear extinction, we hypothesized that Arc expression is required for fear extinction.FindingsExtinction training increased the proportion of Arc-labeled cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Arc was transcribed during latter part of extinction training, which is possibly associated with fear extinction, as well as former part of extinction training. Intra-BLA infusions of Arc antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) before extinction training impaired long-term but not short-term extinction memory.

Intrathecal antagonism of microglial TLR4 reduces inflammatory damage to blood–spinal cord barrier following ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats,"Xiao-Qian Li1,, Jun Wang1,, Bo Fang1,, Wen-Fei Tan1 &, Hong Ma1",Hong Ma,mahong5466@yahoo.com,2014-04-21,"BackgroundInflammatory reaction in blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) plays a crucial role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. It has been shown that microglia could be activated through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Therefore, we hypothesize that TLR4 is involved in the microglial activation and BSCB disruption after I/R.ResultsTo verify our hypothesis, we analyzed the behavioral data, changes of BSCB permeability, as well as expressions of microglial marker Iba-1 and TLR4 in spinal cord I/R model induced by 14 min aortic occlusion. Double immunostaining reveals that after I/R, Iba-1 immunoreactivity increased gradually 12 h after reperfusion and maintained at a such level throughout 36 h. Such increasing pattern of Iba-1 expression is consistent with the increases in Evan’s Blue (EB) extravasation, spinal water content and mechanical allodynia demonstrated by lowed withdrawal threshold to Von Frey filaments. Moreover, double immunostaining suggested that TLR4 was highly expressed in microglia. Intrathecal infusion of minocycline and TAK-242 (TLR4 inhibitor) treatment attenuated I/R-induced allodynia and BSCB leakage. In contrast, LPS induced TLR4 expression aggregated above-mentioned injuries. Furthermore, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity has a similar profile as TLR4 activity. It is consisted with the results of NF-κB mRNA and protein expression changes and activation of downstream cytokine, IL-1β. Expectedly, intrathecal infusion of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NF-κB inhibitor, showed similar protective effects as minocycline and TAK-242. In addition, our data show that TLR4 closely involved in I/R-induced inflammatory damage induced neuronal apoptosis. Significantly, neutralizing TLR4 function largely reduced neuronal apoptosis determined by NeuN immunoreactivity in ventral gray matter and increased percentage of double-label cells with cleaved caspase3, whereas LPS reversed these effects. Similarly, inhibitions of microglia and NF-κB with minocycline or PDTC treatment accordingly perform the same protective effects on I/R injury.ConclusionThe results indicate that compromised BSCB caused by I/R injury lead to spinal microglial activation and TLR4, its membrane-bound receptor, up-regulation, which then initiate neuro-inflammation and neuro-apoptosis via NF-κB/ IL-1β pathway. To inhibit the positive feedback loop of TLR4-microglia-NF-κB/ IL-1β pathway by minocycline, TAK-242 (TLR4 inhibitor) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, NF-κB inhibitor) may provide new targets for treating I/R injury in clinic.","Blood–spinal cord barrier, Intrathecal transplantation, Microglia, Minocycline, Toll-like receptor 4, Spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-28,2014
No requirement of TRPV1 in long-term potentiation or long-term depression in the anterior cingulate cortex,"Ming-Gang Liu1,2 &, Min Zhuo1,2",Min Zhuo,min.zhuo@utoronto.ca,2014-04-05,"One major interest in the study of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) in sensory system is that it may serve as a drug target for treating chronic pain. While the roles of TRPV1 in peripheral nociception and sensitization have been well documented, less is known about its contribution to pain-related cortical plasticity. Here, we used 64 multi-electrode array recording to examine the potential role of TRPV1 in two major forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We found that pharmacological blockade of TRPV1 with either [(E)-3-(4-t-Butylphenyl)-N-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)acrylamide] (AMG9810, 10 μM) or N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamide (SB366791, 20 μM) failed to affect LTP induced by strong theta burst stimulation in the ACC of adult mice. Similarly, neither AMG9810 nor SB366791 blocked the cingulate LTD induced by low-frequency stimulation. Analysis of the results from different layers of the ACC obtained the same conclusions. Spatial distribution of LTP or LTD-showing channels among the ACC network was also unaltered by the TRPV1 antagonists. Since cortical LTP and LTD in the ACC play critical roles in chronic pain triggered by inflammation or nerve injury, our findings suggest that TRPV1 may not be a viable target for treating chronic pain, especially at the cortical level.","Anterior cingulate cortex, Long-term potentiation, Long-term depression, Multi-electrode array, Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1, Chronic pain",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-27,2014

Mechanisms and physiological impacts for this relocation remain elusive, which may rely on input signal patterns and intrinsic properties in these subcellular compartments. We examined this hypothesis at the soma and axon of cortical pyramidal neurons by analyzing their spike capability and voltage-gated sodium channel dynamics in response to different input signals.ResultsElectrophysiological recordings were simultaneously conducted at the somata and axons of identical pyramidal neurons in the cortical slices. The somata dominantly produced sequential spikes in response to long-time steady depolarization pulse, and the axons produced more spikes in response to fluctuated pulse. Compared with the axons, the somata possessed lower spike threshold and shorter refractory periods in response to long-time steady depolarization, and somatic voltage-gated sodium channels demonstrated less inactivation and easier reactivation in response to steady depolarization. Based on local VGSC dynamics, computational simulated spike initiation locations were consistent with those from the experiments. In terms of physiological impact, this input-dependent plasticity of spike initiation location made neuronal encoding to be efficient.ConclusionsLong-time steady depolarization primarily induces somatic spikes and short-time pulses induce axonal spikes.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying itch processing in the central nervous system remain largely unknown.ResultsWe report here that activation of ERK signaling in the spinal cord is required for itch sensation. ERK activation, as revealed by anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 immunostaining, is observed in the spinal dorsal horn of mice treated with intradermal injections of histamine and compound 48/80 but not chloroquine or SLIGRL-NH2, indicating that ERK activation only occurs in histamine-dependent acute itch. In addition, ERK activation is also observed in 2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced itch. Consistently, intrathecal administration of the ERK phosphorylation inhibitor U0126 dramatically reduces the scratching behaviors induced by histamine and DNFB, but not by chloroquine. Furthermore, administration of the histamine receptor H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine decreases the scratching behaviors and ERK activation induced by histamine, but has no effect on DNFB-induced itch responses. Finally, the patch-clamp recording shows that in histamine-, chloroquine- and DNFB-treated mice the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) of dorsal horn neurons is increased, and the decrease of action potential threshold is largely prevented by bathing of U0126 in histamine- and DNFB-treated mice but not those treated with chloroquine.ConclusionOur results demonstrate a critical role for ERK activation in itch sensation at the spinal level.","Acute itch, Chronic itch, pERK, H1 receptor, Spinal cord, Atopic dermatitis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-25,2014

Recently developed technology for generating transgenic marmosets has opened new avenues for faithful recapitulation of human diseases, which could not be achieved in rodent models. However, the longer lifespan of common marmosets compared with rodents may result in an extended period for in vivo analysis of common marmoset disease models. Therefore, establishing rapid and efficient techniques for obtaining neuronal cells from transgenic individuals that enable in vitro analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying diseases are required. Recently, several groups have reported on methods, termed direct reprogramming, to generate neuronal cells by defined factors from somatic cells of various kinds of species, including mouse and human. The aim of the present study was to determine whether direct reprogramming technology was applicable to common marmosets.ResultsCommon marmoset induced neuronal (cjiN) cells with neuronal morphology were generated from common marmoset embryonic skin fibroblasts (cjF) by overexpressing the neuronal transcription factors: ASCL1, BRN2, MYT1L and NEUROD1. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of cjiN cells showed upregulation of neuronal genes highly related to neuronal differentiation and function. The presence of neuronal marker proteins was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Electrical field stimulation to cjiN cells increased the intracellular calcium level, which was reversibly blocked by the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, indicating that these cells were functional. The neuronal function of these cells was further confirmed by electrophysiological analyses showing that action potentials could be elicited by membrane depolarization in current-clamp mode while both fast-activating and inactivating sodium currents and outward currents were observed in voltage-clamp mode. The 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay showed that cjiN cells were directly converted from cjFs without passing a proliferative state.ConclusionsFunctional common marmoset neuronal cells can be obtained directly from embryonic fibroblasts by overexpressing four neuronal transcription factors under in vitro conditions.

Despite the well-established function of evoked release, the neuronal information transmission, the origin as well as the function of spontaneously fusing synaptic vesicles have remained elusive. Recently spontaneous release was found to e.g. regulate postsynaptic protein synthesis or has been linked to depressive disorder. Nevertheless the strength and cellular localization of this release form was neglected so far, which are both essential parameters in neuronal information processing.FindingsHere we show that the complete recycling pool can be turned over by spontaneous trafficking and that spontaneous fusion rates critically depend on the neuronal localization of the releasing synapse. Thereby, the distribution equals that of evoked release so that both findings demonstrate a uniform regulation of these fusion modes.ConclusionsIn contrast to recent works, our results strengthen the assumption that identical vesicles are used for evoked and spontaneous release and extended the knowledge about spontaneous fusion with respect to its amount and cellular localization. Therefore our data supported the hypothesis of a regulatory role of spontaneous release in neuronal outgrowth and plasticity as neurites secrete neurotransmitters to initiate process outgrowth of a possible postsynaptic neuron to form a new synaptic connection.","Synaptic Vesicle, Spontaneous Release, Vesicle Release, Reserve Pool, Calcium Dependent Manner",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-23,2014

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that GAPDH translocates to the nucleus in a Siah1-dependent manner upon glutamate stimulation. The nuclear GAPDH forms a protein complex with p53 and enhances p53 expression and phosphorylation. Disruption of the GAPDH-p53 interaction with an interfering peptide blocks glutamate-induced cell death and GAPDH-mediated up-regulation of p53 expression and phosphorylation.

The mechanisms that underlie transcriptional regulation in the brain, however, remain unclear. The Ntng1 and Ntng2 genes, encoding axonal membrane adhesion proteins netrin-G1 and netrin-G2, respectively, are paralogs that have evolved in vertebrates and are expressed in distinct neuronal subsets in a complementary manner. The characteristic expression patterns of these genes provide a part of the foundation of the cortical layer structure in mammals.ResultsWe used gene-targeting techniques, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-aided transgenesis techniques, and in vivo enhancer assays to examine transcriptional mechanisms in vivo to gain insight into how the characteristic expression patterns of these genes are acquired. Analysis of the gene expression patterns in the presence or absence of netrin-G1 and netrin-G2 functional proteins allowed us to exclude the possibility that a feedback or feedforward mechanism mediates their characteristic expression patterns. Findings from the BAC deletion series revealed that widely distributed combinations of cis-regulatory elements determine the differential gene expression patterns of these genes and that major cis-regulatory elements are located in the 85–45 kb upstream region of Ntng2 and in the 75–60 kb upstream region and intronic region of Ntng1. In vivo enhancer assays using 2-kb evolutionarily conserved regions detected enhancer activity in the distal upstream regions of both genes.ConclusionsThe complementary expression patterns of Ntng1 and Ntng2 are determined by transcriptional cis-regulatory elements widely scattered in these loci.

To facilitate the study of ionic conductances of astrocytes, we have developed a dual patch recording method which permits membrane current and membrane potential to be simultaneously recorded from astrocytes in spite of their extraordinarily low membrane resistance. The utility of this technique is demonstrated by measuring the voltage-dependent activation of the inwardly rectifying K+ current abundantly expressed in astrocytes and multiple ionic events associated with astrocytic GABAA receptor activation.

We previously reported that SM-216289, a semaphorin3A inhibitor, enhanced axon regeneration and motor function recovery in SCT adult rats. However, these effects were limited because most regenerated axons likely do not connect to the right targets. Thus, rebuilding the appropriate connections for regenerated axons may enhance recovery. In this study, we combined semaphorin3A inhibitor treatment with extensive treadmill training to determine whether combined treatment would further enhance the “rewiring” of regenerated axons. In this study, which aimed for clinical applicability, we administered a newly developed, potent semaphorin3A inhibitor, SM-345431 (Vinaxanthone), using a novel drug delivery system that enables continuous drug delivery over the period of the experiment.ResultsTreatment with SM-345431 using this delivery system enhanced axon regeneration and produced significant, but limited, hindlimb motor function recovery. Although extensive treadmill training combined with SM-345431 administration did not further improve axon regeneration, hindlimb motor performance was restored, as evidenced by the significant improvement in the execution of plantar steps on a treadmill. In contrast, control SCT rats could not execute plantar steps at any point during the experimental period. Further analyses suggested that this strategy reinforced the wiring of central pattern generators in lumbar spinal circuits, which, in turn, led to enhanced motor function recovery (especially in extensor muscles).ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of combining treatments that promote axon regeneration with specific and appropriate rehabilitations that promote rewiring for the treatment of spinal cord injury.","Axonal regeneration, Semaphorin3A, Inhibitor, Rehabilitation, Rewiring, Drug delivery system",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-14,2014

Zinc can modulate synaptic plasticity, memory formation and nociception by regulating transmitter receptors and signal transduction pathways. Also, intracellular zinc accumulation is a hallmark of degenerating neurons in several neurological disorders. To date, no single zinc extrusion mechanism has been directly localized to synapses. Based on the presence of a canonical PDZ I motif in the Zinc Transporter-1 protein (ZnT1), we hypothesized that ZnT1 may be targeted to synaptic compartments for local control of cytosolic zinc. Using our previously developed protocol for the co-localization of reactive zinc and synaptic proteins, we further asked if ZnT1 expression correlates with presynaptic zinc content in individual synapses.FindingsHere we demonstrate that ZnT1 is a plasma membrane protein that is enriched in dendritic spines and in biochemically isolated synaptic membranes.

The molecular sequence and three-dimensional structure of AChE are homologous to the corresponding aspects of the ectodomain of neuroligin. This study investigated whether excess AChE interacts physically with neurexin to destabilize glutamatergic synapses.ResultsThe results showed that AChE clusters colocalized with neurexin assemblies in the neurites of hippocampal neurons and that AChE co-immunoprecipitated with neurexin from the lysate of these neurons. Moreover, when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, N-glycosylated AChE co-immunoprecipitated with non-O–glycosylated neurexin-1β, with N-glycosylation of the AChE being required for this co-precipitation to occur. Increasing extracellular AChE decreased the association of neurexin with neuroligin and inhibited neuroligin-induced synaptogenesis. The number and activity of excitatory synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons were reduced by extracellular catalytically inactive AChE.ConclusionsExcessive glycosylated AChE could competitively disrupt a subset of the neurexin–neuroligin junctions consequently impairing the integrity of glutamatergic synapses. This might serve a molecular mechanism of excessive AChE induced neurodegeneration.","Protein interaction, Glycosylation, Neurodegeneration, Synaptic apoptosis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-15,2014
Role of adult neurogenesis in hippocampal-cortical memory consolidation,"Takashi Kitamura1 &, Kaoru Inokuchi2,3",Kaoru Inokuchi,inokuchi@med.u-toyama.ac.jp,2014-02-19,"Acquired memory is initially dependent on the hippocampus (HPC) for permanent memory formation. This hippocampal dependency of memory recall progressively decays with time, a process that is associated with a gradual increase in dependency upon cortical structures. This process is commonly referred to as systems consolidation theory. In this paper, we first review how memory becomes hippocampal dependent to cortical dependent with an emphasis on the interactions that occur between the HPC and cortex during systems consolidation. We also review the mechanisms underlying the gradual decay of HPC dependency during systems consolidation from the perspective of memory erasures by adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

Of the three family members, BRINP1 is the most highly expressed in various brain regions, including the hippocampus, in adult mice and its expression in dentate gyrus (DG) is markedly induced by neural activity. In the present study, we generated BRINP1-deficient (KO) mice to clarify the physiological functions of BRINP1 in the nervous system.ResultsNeurogenesis in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus was increased in BRINP1-KO mice creating a more immature neuronal population in granule cell layer. The number of parvalbumin expressing interneuron in hippocampal CA1 subregion was also increased in BRINP1-KO mice. Furthermore, BRINP1-KO mice showed abnormal behaviors with increase in locomotor activity, reduced anxiety-like behavior, poor social interaction, and slight impairment of working memory, all of which resemble symptoms of human psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and attention–deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).ConclusionsAbsence of BRINP1 causes deregulation of neurogenesis and impairments of neuronal differentiation in adult hippocampal circuitry. Abnormal behaviors comparable to those of human psychiatric disorders such as hyperactivity and poor social behavior were observed in BRINP1-KO mice.

However, VPS35/retromer’s function in retina or the contribution of Vps35-deficiency to retinal neuro-degenerative disorders has not been investigated.

Additionally, gliosis in the optic nerve is transiently elevated in neonatal, but reduced in aged Vps35+/m mice. Optic nerve injury-induced gliosis is also attenuated in Vps35+/m mice.

Furthermore, transfection of mGlu1α receptor with mutated caveolin-binding domain reduced localization of the receptor to lipid rafts. Also, application of a peptide blocker of mGlu1α receptor and caveolin binding reduced the Ca2+ signaling and the lipid rafts localization.ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that the binding of mGlu1α receptor to caveolin is crucial for its lipid rafts localization and mGlu1α receptor-mediated Ca2+ transients.","mGlu1α receptor, Lipid rafts, Caveolin, Calcium",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-9,2014

Primary symptoms of the pathology include seizures, ataxia, myoclonus, and progressive development of severe dementia. Lafora disease can be caused by defects in the EPM2A gene, which encodes the laforin protein phosphatase, or in the NHLRC1 gene (also called EPM2B) codifying the malin E3 ubiquitin ligase. Studies on cellular models showed that laforin and malin interact and operate as a functional complex apparently regulating cellular functions such as glycogen metabolism, cellular stress response, and the proteolytic processes. However, the pathogenesis and the molecular mechanism of the disease, which imply either laforin or malin are poorly understood. Thus, the aim of our study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the pathology by characterizing cerebral cortex neurodegeneration in the well accepted murine model of Lafora disease EPM2A-/- mouse.ResultsIn this article, we want to asses the primary cause of the neurodegeneration in Lafora disease by studying GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex. We showed that the majority of Lafora bodies are specifically located in GABAergic neurons of the cerebral cortex of 3 months-old EPM2A-/- mice. Moreover, GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex of younger mice (1 month-old) are decreased in number and present altered neurotrophins and p75NTR signalling.ConclusionsHere, we concluded that there is impairment in GABAergic neurons neurodevelopment in the cerebral cortex, which occurs prior to the formation of Lafora bodies in the cytoplasm. The dysregulation of cerebral cortex development may contribute to Lafora disease pathogenesis.","BDNF, Cerebral cortex, GABAergic neurons, Lafora disease, Laforin, Neurotrophin, NGF, p75NTR",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-7,2014
Allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors by extracellular ATP,"Jun Liu1 nAff3 &, Yu Tian Wang1,2",Yu Tian Wang,ytwang@brain.ubc.ca,2014-01-24,"BackgroundThe γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) is the primary receptor mediating fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and plays a critical role in modulation of neuronal excitability and neural networks. Previous studies have demonstrated that ATP and its nucleotide analogs may regulate the function of GABAARs via Ca2+-dependent intracellular mechanisms, which require activation of purinergic 2 (P2) receptors or cross-talk between two receptors.ResultsHere, we report a potentiation of GABAARs by extracellular ATP via a previously un-recognized allosteric mechanism. Using cultured hippocampal neurons as well as HEK293 cells transiently expressing GABAARs, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP potentiates GABAAR mediated currents in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 2.1 ± 0.2 mM. The potentiation was mediated by a postsynaptic mechanism that was not dependent on activation of either ecto-protein kinase or P2 receptors. Single channel recordings from cell-free excised membrane patches under outside-out mode or isolated membrane patches under cell-attached mode suggest that the ATP modulation of GABA currents is achieved through a direct action of ATP on the channels themselves and manifested by increasing the single channel open probability without alteration of its conductance. Moreover, this ATP potentiation of GABAAR could be reconstituted in HEK293 cells that transiently expressed recombinant rat GABAARs.ConclusionsOur data strongly suggest that extracellular ATP allosterically potentiates GABAAR-gated chloride channels. This novel mode of ATP-mediated modulation of GABAARs may play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and thereby in fine-tuning the excitation-inhibition balance under conditions where a high level of extracellular ATP is ensured.","GABAA receptor, ATP, Allosteric potentiation, Neuronal cultures",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-6,2014

This modification alters the amino acid sequence and function of the receptor. Glutamatergic signaling has been suggested to have a role in mood disorders and schizophrenia, but it is unknown whether altered RNA editing of AMPA/kainate receptors has pathophysiological significance in these mental disorders. In this study, we found that ADAR2 expression tended to be decreased in the postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.ResultsDecreased ADAR2 expression was significantly correlated with decreased editing of the R/G sites of AMPA receptors. In heterozygous Adar2 knockout mice (Adar2+/− mice), editing of the R/G sites of AMPA receptors was decreased. Adar2+/− mice showed a tendency of increased activity in the open-field test and a tendency of resistance to immobility in the forced swimming test. They also showed enhanced amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. There was no significant difference in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity between Adar2+/− and wild type mice after the treatment with an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline.ConclusionsThese findings collectively suggest that altered RNA editing efficiency of AMPA receptors due to down-regulation of ADAR2 has a possible role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.","RNA editing, Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2, AMPA/kainate receptors, Serotonin 2C receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-5,2014

The concurrent discovery of the three ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET) which not only synthesize but also oxidize hmdC in DNA, prior to glycosylase removal and base excision repair, helps explain many heretofore unexplained phenomena in brain including: 1) the high concentration of ascorbic acid (AA) in neurons since AA is a cofactor for the TET enzymes, 2) the requirement for reduced folates and the dN synthetic enzymes in brain, 3) continued DNA synthesis in non-dividing neurons to repair the dynamic formation/removal of hmdC, and 4) the heretofore unexplained mechanism to remove 5-methyldeoxycytidine, the fifth nucleoside, from DNA. In these processes, we also describe the important role of choroid plexus and CSF in supporting vitamin homeostasis in brain: especially for AA and folates, for hmdC synthesis and removal, and methylated deoxycytidine (mdC) removal from DNA in brain.

The spike propagation is presumably initiated by local currents that raise membrane potential to the threshold of activating voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC).ResultsWe have investigated the natures of spike propagation and the role of VGSCs in this process by recording spikes simultaneously on the somata and axonal terminals of Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. The velocity and fidelity of spike propagation decreased during long-lasting spikes, to which the velocity change was more sensitive than fidelity change.

Here, we demonstrate an analysis workflow that allows for the detection of differences in specific neuropeptides amongst a variety of neuropeptides being simultaneously measured. For sample preparation, we describe a straight-forward and rapid (minutes) method where individual adult Drosophila melanogaster brains are analyzed. Using a MATLAB-based data analysis workflow, also compatible with MALDI-TOF mass spectra obtained from other sample preparations and instrumentation, we demonstrate how changes in neuropeptides levels can be detected with this method.ResultsOver fifty isotopically resolved ion signals in the peptide mass range are reproducibly observed across experiments. MALDI-TOF MS profile spectra were used to statistically identify distinct relative differences in organ-wide endogenous levels of detected neuropeptides between biological conditions. In particular, three distinct levels of a particular neuropeptide, pigment dispersing factor, were detected by comparing groups of preprocessed spectra obtained from individual brains across three different D. melanogaster strains, each of which express different amounts of this neuropeptide.

Inadequate sleep due to chronic pain may contribute to the stressful negative consequences of living with pain. However, the neurophysiological mechanism by which chronic pain affects sleep-arousal patterns is as yet unknown. Although serotonin (5-HT) was proposed to be responsible for sleep regulation, whether the activity of 5-HTergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is affected by chronic pain has been studied only infrequently. On the other hand, the recent development of optogenetic tools has provided a valuable opportunity to regulate the activity in genetically targeted neural populations with high spatial and temporal precision. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic pain could induce sleep dysregulation while changing the activity of DRN-5-HTergic neurons. Furthermore, we sought to physiologically activate the DRN with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to identify a causal role for the DRN-5-HT system in promoting and maintaining wakefulness using optogenetics.ResultsWe produced a sciatic nerve ligation model by tying a tight ligature around approximately one-third to one-half the diameter of the sciatic nerve. In mice with nerve ligation, we confirmed an increase in wakefulness and a decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep as monitored by electroencephalogram (EEG). Microinjection of the retrograde tracer fluoro-gold (FG) into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) revealed several retrogradely labeled-cells in the DRN. The key finding of the present study was that the levels of 5-HT released in the PFC by the electrical stimulation of DRN neurons were significantly increased in mice with sciatic nerve ligation. Using optogenetic tools in mice, we found a causal relationship among DRN neuron firing, cortical activity and sleep-to-wake transitions. In particular, the activation of DRN-5-HTergic neurons produced a significant increase in wakefulness and a significant decrease in NREM sleep. The duration of NREM sleep episodes was significantly decreased during photostimulation in these mice.ConclusionsThese results suggest that neuropathic pain accelerates the activity of DRN-5-HTergic neurons. Although further loss-of-function experiments are required, we hypothesize that this activation in DRN neurons may, at least in part, correlate with sleep dysregulation under a neuropathic pain-like state.","Optogenetics, Electroencephalogram, Dorsal raphe nucleus, Neuropathic pain, Sleep",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-59,2013

We previously reported that phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDA receptor antagonist, increased locomotor activity in wildtype (WT) mice but not GluN2D subunit knockout mice. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the GluN2D subunit is involved in PCP-induced motor impairment.ResultsPCP or UBP141 (a GluN2D antagonist) induced potent motor impairment in WT mice but not GluN2D KO mice. By contrast, CIQ, a GluN2C/2D potentiator, induced severe motor impairment in GluN2D KO mice but not WT mice, suggesting that the GluN2D subunit plays an essential role in the effects of PCP and UBP141, and an appropriate balance between GluN2C and GluN2D subunits might be needed for appropriate motor performance. The level of the GluN2D subunit in the mature mouse brain is very low and restricted. GluN2D subunits exist in brainstem structures, the globus pallidus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus. We found that the expression of the c-fos gene increased the most among PCP-dependent differentially expressed genes between WT and GluN2D KO mice, and the number of Fos-positive cells increased after PCP administration in the basal ganglia motor circuit in WT mice but not GluN2D KO mice.ConclusionThese results suggest that the GluN2D subunit within the motor circuitry is a key subunit for PCP-induced motor impairment, which requires an intricate balance between GluN2C- and GluN2D-mediated excitatory outputs.","GluN2C, GluN2D, Motor impairment, Motor loop, PCP",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-56,2013

Mutant HTT (mHtt) leads to progressive impairment of several molecular pathways that have been linked to disease pathogenesis. Defects in the production of a number of neurotrophic factors have been described as important determinants contributing to the development of HD. We have previously demonstrated that production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is also deregulated in HD. Peripheral levels of TGF-β1 were markedly reduced early in the disease and returned to normal levels with disease severity. However, the cause and the biochemical origin of such abnormalities are still unclear.ResultsWe report here that the abnormal production of peripheral TGF-β1 depends on the changes in the percentage of TGF-β1-producing macrophages along disease course. Variation in the number of TGF-β1-producing macrophages resulted from differential activation state of the same cells, which displayed phenotypic and functional heterogeneity throughout the clinical course of HD. We further demonstrated that, similar to the periphery, the number of TGF-β1-immunoreactive cells in human post-mortem brain with HD, varied with neuropathological changes.ConclusionsOur data indicate that reduced bioavailability of TGF-β1 in the serum of HD subjects is attributable to the variation of the number of TGF-β1-producing macrophages. Macrophages display a differential ability to produce TGF-β1, which reflects diversity in cells polarization throughout the disease course. Besides elucidating the biochemical origin of TGF-β1 fluctuations in HD, our study highlights an interesting parallelism between periphery and central compartment and underlines the potential of TGF-β1 as a possible indicator suitable for prediction of disease onset in HD.","Cytokines in Huntington disease, TGF-β1, Monocytes-derived macrophages, Macrophages polarization",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-55,2013
High glutamate permeability and distal localization of Best1 channel in CA1 hippocampal astrocyte,"Hyungju Park1,, Kyung-Seok Han1,2,, Soo-Jin Oh1,, Seonmi Jo1,4,, Junsung Woo1,2,, Bo-Eun Yoon1,5 &, C Justin Lee1,2,3",C Justin Lee,cjl@kist.re.kr,2013-12-09,"BackgroundGlutamate is the major neurotransmitter that mediates a principal form of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. From the presynaptic terminals of neurons, glutamate is released upon exocytosis of the glutamate-packaged vesicles. In recent years, astrocytes are also known to release glutamate via various routes to modulate synaptic transmission. In particular, we have characterized a glutamate-permeable Ca2+-activated anion channel encoded by Bestrophin 1 gene (Best1) that is responsible for Ca2+-dependent, channel-mediated glutamate release in astrocyte. Best1 channel contains a large pore that is readily permeable to large molecules such as glutamate and GABA. In those studies we obtained permeability ratio of glutamate to Cl- in heterologously expressed mouse Best1 in HEK293T cells and in endogenously expressed mouse Best1 in cultured astrocytes. However, up to now, glutamate permeability of the native Best1 channel in vivo has not been reported.FindingsIn whole-cell recordings of CA1 hippocampal astrocytes, we found that opening of Best1 channel upon activation of a Gq-coupled GPCR, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) generated the anion current carried by glutamate via Ca2+ increase. This Ca2+-evoked glutamate-mediated anion current was unaffected by pretreatment of the inhibitors for a gap junction hemi-channel or Ca2+-activated K+ conductance. This astrocytic anion conductance carried by glutamate was mediated by Best1 channel expression in CA1 hippocampal astrocytes, because Best1 knock-down by shRNA expression eliminated astrocytic glutamate conductance by PAR-1 activation. However, we found that these astrocytes showed a deviation in reversal potential of Best1-mediated current from the predicted value. By performing dual patch recording, we concluded that the deviation of reversal potential is due to incomplete space clamping arising from extremely leaky membrane (input resistance ranging 1–3 MΩ), very low length constant of astrocytic processes, and the localization of Best1 channel in distal microdomains near synapses. Based on the relative shift of reversal potentials by ion substitutions, we estimated the permeability ratio of glutamate and Cl- (Pglutamate/PCl) as 0.53.ConclusionsOur study shows that Best1, located at the microdomains near the synaptic junctions, has a significantly high permeability to glutamate in vivo, serving as the prominent glutamate-releasing channel in astrocytes, mediating the release of various gliotransmitters in the brain, and playing an important role in modulating synaptic transmission.","Astrocyte, Bestrophin-1, Glutamate, Anion channel",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-54,2013

We here report that cortical callosal axons in somatosensory cortex require sensory input for their target selection in contralateral cortex.ResultsEliminating sensory input to either hemisphere by unilateral transection of infraorbital nerve (ION) prevents target selection of callosal axons in contralateral cortex. Strikingly, blocking sensory input bilaterally, by simultaneously transecting both IONs, results in rescued callosal projection. In contrast, non-simultaneous bilateral ION transection has the same effect as unilateral transection. Similar results are obtained by lesion of whisker hair follicles. c-Fos-positive neurons in brain slices treated with KCl is decreased more in contralateral cortex with unilateral removal of sensory input, but decreased similarly in both cortices in mice with simultaneous bilateral removal of sensory input. Frequency of sEPSC of cortical neurons is also reduced in contralateral cortex with the unilateral removal of sensory input, but equally reduced on both sides with the bilateral removal of sensory input, suggesting that unbalanced bilateral sensory input might lead to mismatched neuronal activity between the two cortices and contribute to the formation of callosal projection.ConclusionOur data demonstrate a critical role of balanced bilateral somatosensory input in the formation of callosal connections, and thus reveal a new role of sensory input in wiring brain circuits.","Callosal projection, Sensory input, Axon pathfinding, Somatosensory cortex",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-53,2013

Incorrectly glycosylated proteins induce protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The most common form of CDG, PMM2-CDG, is caused by deficiency in the cytosolic enzyme phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2). Patients with PMM2-CDG exhibit a significantly reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje cells and granule cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the specific cerebellar neurodegeneration in PMM2-CDG, however, remains elusive.ResultsHerein, we report that cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) are more sensitive to tunicamycin (TM)-induced inhibition of total N-glycan synthesis than cortical neurons (CNs). When glycan synthesis was inhibited to a comparable degree, CGCs exhibited more cell death than CNs. Furthermore, downregulation of PMM2 caused more CGCs to die than CNs. Importantly, we found that upon PMM2 downregulation or TM treatment, ER-stress response proteins were elevated less significantly in CGCs than in CNs, with the GRP78/BiP level showing the most significant difference. We further demonstrate that overexpression of GRP78/BiP rescues the death of CGCs resulting from either TM-treatment or PMM2 downregulation.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the selective susceptibility of cerebellar neurons to N-glycosylation defects is due to these neurons’ inefficient response to ER stress, providing important insight into the mechanisms of selective neurodegeneration observed in CDG patients.","Cerebellar granule cells, Congenital disorders of glycosylation, Cortical neurons, Endoplasmic reticulum stress, GRP78/BiP, Neurodegeneration, Phosphomannomutase 2",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-52,2013

We found that STIM1 works together with TRPC1 to mediate SOCE within growth cones and filopodia. In particular, STIM1/TRPC1-dependent SOCE was found to mediate oscillatory filopodial Ca2+ transients in the growth cone. Disruption of STIM1 function abolished filopodial Ca2+ transients and impaired Ca2+-dependent attractive responses of Xenopus growth cones to netrin-1.

Angiotensin II potentiates zinc-induced cortical neuronal death by acting on angiotensin II type 2 receptor,"Mi-Ha Park1,, Ha Na Kim1,, Joon Seo Lim1,3,, Jae-Sung Ahn2 &, Jae-Young Koh1,2",Jae-Young Koh,jkko@amc.seoul.kr,2013-12-01,"BackgroundThe angiotensin system has several non-vascular functions in the central nervous system. For instance, inhibition of the brain angiotensin system results in a reduction in neuronal death following acute brain injury such as ischemia and intracerebral hemorrhage, even under conditions of constant blood pressure. Since endogenous zinc has been implicated as a key mediator of ischemic neuronal death, we investigated the possibility that the angiotensin system affects the outcome of zinc-triggered neuronal death in cortical cell cultures.ResultsExposure of cortical cultures containing neurons and astrocytes to 300 μM zinc for 15 min induced submaximal death in both types of cells. Interestingly, addition of angiotensin II significantly enhanced the zinc-triggered neuronal death, while leaving astrocytic cell death relatively unchanged. Both type 1 and 2 angiotensin II receptors (AT1R and AT2R, respectively) were expressed in neurons as well as astrocytes. Zinc neurotoxicity was substantially attenuated by PD123319, a specific inhibitor of AT2R, and augmented by CGP42112, a selective activator of AT2R, indicating a critical role for this receptor subtype in the augmentation of neuronal cell death.Because zinc toxicity occurs largely through oxidative stress, the levels of superoxides in zinc-treated neurons were assessed by DCF fluorescence microscopy. Combined treatment with zinc and angiotensin II substantially increased the levels of superoxides in neurons compared to those induced by zinc alone. This increase in oxidative stress by angiotensin II was completely blocked by the addition of PD123319. Finally, since zinc-induced oxidative stress may be caused by induction and/or activation of NADPH oxidase, the activation status of Rac and the level of the NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox were measured. Angiotensin II markedly increased Rac activity and the levels of p67phox in zinc-treated neurons and astrocytes in a PD123319-dependent manner.ConclusionThe present study shows that the angiotensin system, especially that involving AT2R, may have an oxidative injury-potentiating effect via augmentation of the activity of NADPH oxidase. Hence, blockade of angiotensin signaling cascades in the brain may prove useful in protecting against the oxidative neuronal death that is likely to occur in acute brain injury.","Zinc, Angiotensin, Neuronal cell death, NAPDH oxidase",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-50,2013
Molecular events in the cell types of the olfactory epithelium during adult neurogenesis,"Paula M Heron1,, Arnold J Stromberg2,, Patrick Breheny3 &, Timothy S McClintock1",Timothy S McClintock,mcclint@uky.edu,2013-11-22,"BackgroundAdult neurogenesis, fundamental for cellular homeostasis in the mammalian olfactory epithelium, requires major shifts in gene expression to produce mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) from multipotent progenitor cells. To understand these dynamic events requires identifying not only the genes involved but also the cell types that express each gene. Only then can the interrelationships of the encoded proteins reveal the sequences of molecular events that control the plasticity of the adult olfactory epithelium.ResultsOf 4,057 differentially abundant mRNAs at 5 days after lesion-induced OSN replacement in adult mice, 2,334 were decreased mRNAs expressed by mature OSNs. Of the 1,723 increased mRNAs, many were expressed by cell types other than OSNs and encoded proteins involved in cell proliferation and transcriptional regulation, consistent with increased basal cell proliferation. Others encoded fatty acid metabolism and lysosomal proteins expressed by infiltrating macrophages that help scavenge debris from the apoptosis of mature OSNs. The mRNAs of immature OSNs behaved dichotomously, increasing if they supported early events in OSN differentiation (axon initiation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization and focal adhesions) but decreasing if they supported homeostatic processes that carry over into mature OSNs (energy production, axon maintenance and protein catabolism). The complexity of shifts in gene expression responsible for converting basal cells into neurons was evident in the increased abundance of 203 transcriptional regulators expressed by basal cells and immature OSNs.ConclusionsMany of the molecular changes evoked during adult neurogenesis can now be ascribed to specific cellular events in the OSN cell lineage, thereby defining new stages in the development of these neurons. Most notably, the patterns of gene expression in immature OSNs changed in a characteristic fashion as these neurons differentiated. Initial patterns were consistent with the transition into a neuronal morphology (neuritogenesis) and later patterns with neuronal homeostasis. Overall, gene expression patterns during adult olfactory neurogenesis showed substantial similarity to those of embryonic brain.","Smell, Development, Differentiation, Neuritogenesis, Immature neuron, Transcription factor, Stem cell, Microarray, Genomics",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-49,2013

The mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptor plays a key role in mechanisms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum, and its dysfunction is linked to the pathophysiology of motor symptoms associated with SCA1. We used SCA1 heterozygous transgenic mice (Q154/Q2) as a model for testing the hypothesis that drugs that enhance mGlu1 receptor function may be good candidates for the medical treatment of SCA1.ResultsSymptomatic 30-week old SCA1 mice showed reduced mGlu1 receptor mRNA and protein levels in the cerebellum. Interestingly, these mice also showed an intense expression of mGlu5 receptors in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which normally lack these receptors. Systemic treatment of SCA1 mice with the mGlu1 receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM), Ro0711401 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), caused a prolonged improvement of motor performance on the rotarod and the paw-print tests. A single injection of Ro0711401 improved motor symptoms for several days, and no tolerance developed to the drug. In contrast, the mGlu5 receptor PAM, VU0360172 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), caused only a short-lasting improvement of motor symptoms, whereas the mGlu1 receptor antagonist, JNJ16259685 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), further impaired motor performance in SCA1 mice. The prolonged symptomatic benefit caused by Ro0711401 outlasted the time of drug clearance from the cerebellum, and was associated with neuroadaptive changes in the cerebellum, such as a striking reduction of the ectopically expressed mGlu5 receptors in Purkinje cells, increases in levels of total and Ser880-phosphorylated GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors, and changes in the length of spines in the distal dendrites of Purkinje cells.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of mGlu1 receptors causes a robust and sustained motor improvement in SCA1 mice, and lay the groundwork for the development of mGlu1 receptor PAMs as novel “cerebellum-specific”, effective, and safe symptomatic drugs for the treatment of SCA1 in humans.","mGlu1 receptor, Ro0711401, mGlu5 receptor, VU0360172, JNJ16259685, Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, Purkinje cell, Motor coordination",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-48,2013

The generallyaccepted effect of chronic FLX treatment is increased adult neurogenesis inthe hippocampal dentate gyrus. It was recently demonstrated that FLXtreatments can reverse the established neuronal maturation of granule cellsin the hippocampal dentate gyrus and of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic(GABAergic) interneurons in the basolateral amygdala. However, it is notclear whether this dematuration effect of FLX occurs in other brain regions.Thus, in this study, we used immunohistological analysis to assess theeffect of FLX treatment on GABAergic interneurons in the medial frontalcortex (mFC) and reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN).ResultsImmunofluorescence analysis for perineuronal nets (PNNs), which is a markerof neuronal maturation, and for parvalbumin, calretinin, and somatostatin,which are markers for specific GABAergic interneuron type, showed lowernumber of parvalbumin-positive (+) cells and PNN+/parvalbumin+ cellsin the mFC of FLX-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. However,FLX treatment had no effect on the number of cells expressing calretinin andsomatostatin in the mFC. In the RTN, the number of PNN+ cells andparvalbumin+ cells was unaltered by FLX treatments. Furthermore, thenumber of total GABA+ cells and apoptotic cells in the mFC was similarbetween vehicle- and FLX-treated mice, suggesting that FLX treatment did notinduce cell death in this region. Rather, our findings suggest that thedecreased number of parvalbumin+ cells in the mFC was due to adecreased expression of parvalbumin proteins in the interneurons.ConclusionsThis study indicates that FLX decreases the levels of parvalbumin, a maturemarker of fast-spiking interneurons, and PNNs in parvalbumin+ interneuronsin the mFC, suggesting that FLX treatment induces a dematuration of thistype of neurons.

We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that impaired IL-1α and IL-1β expression in DRG may contribute to aberrant axon regeneration and plasticity seen in diabetic sensory neuropathy. In addition, we determined if these cytokines could optimize mitochondrial bioenergetics since mitochondrial dysfunction is a key etiological factor in diabetic neuropathy.ResultsCytokines IL-1α and IL-1β were reduced 2-fold (p<0.05) in DRG and/or nerve of 2 and 5 month streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats.

Likewise, the glutamate ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has been implicated in certain neurological disorders, such as neurodegeration, neuropathic pain and mood disorders, as well as psychosis and schizophrenia. Thus, there is now an important need to characterize the interactions between GPCRs and NMDARs. Indeed, these interactions can produce distinct effects, and whereas the activation of Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) increases the calcium fluxes associated to NMDARs, that of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CNR1) antagonizes their permeation. Notably, a series of proteins interact with these receptors affecting their responses and interactions, and then emerge as novel therapeutic targets for the aforementioned pathologies.ResultsWe found that in the presence of GPCRs, the HINT1 protein influences the activity of NMDARs, whereby NMDAR activation was enhanced in CNR1+/+/HINT1-/- cortical neurons and the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 provided these cells with no protection against a NMDA insult. NMDAR activity was normalized in these cells by the lentiviral expression of HINT1, which also restored the neuroprotection mediated by cannabinoids. NMDAR activity was also enhanced in CNR1-/-/HINT1+/+ neurons, although this activity was dampened by the expression of GPCRs like the MOR, CNR1 or serotonin 1A (5HT1AR).ConclusionsThe HINT1 protein plays an essential role in the GPCR-NMDAR connection. In the absence of receptor activation, GPCRs collaborate with HINT1 proteins to negatively control NMDAR activity. When activated, most GPCRs release the control of HINT1 and NMDAR responsiveness is enhanced. However, cannabinoids that act through CNR1 maintain the negative control of HINT1 on NMDAR function and their protection against glutamate excitotoxic insult persists.","HINT1 protein, Cannabinoid receptor, NMDA receptor, Cortical neuron cultures, Excitotoxicity, Neuroprotection",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-42,2013

We previously demonstrated that sires of a strain of nonmonogamous laboratory mice initiate parental retrieval behavior in response to olfactory and auditory signals from the dam during isolation in a new environment. This behavior is rapidly lost in the absence of such signals when the sires are caged alone. The neural circuitry and hormones that control paternal behavior are not well-understood. CD38, a membrane glycoprotein, catalyzes synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose and facilitates oxytocin (OT) secretion due to cyclic ADP-ribose-dependent increases in cytosolic free calcium concentrations in oxytocinergic neurons in the hypothalamus. In this paper, we studied CD38 in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the role of OT on paternal pup retrieval behavior using CD38 knockout (CD38−/−) mice of the ICR strain.ResultsCD38−/− sires failed to retrieve when they were reunited with their pups after isolation together with the mate dams, but not with pup, in a novel cage for 10 min. CD38−/− sires treated with a single subcutaneous injection of OT exhibited recovery in the retrieval events when caged with CD38−/− dams treated with OT. We introduced human CD38 in the NAcc of CD38−/− sires using a lentiviral infection technique and examined the effects of local expression of CD38. Pairs of knockout dams treated with OT and sires expressing CD38 in the NAcc showed more retrieval (83% of wild-type sire levels). Complete recovery of retrieval was obtained in sires with the expression of CD38 in the NAcc in combination with OT administration. Other paternal behaviors, including pup grooming, crouching and huddling, were also more common in CD38−/− sires with CD38 expression in the NAcc compared with those in CD38−/− sires without CD38 expression in the NAcc.ConclusionsCD38 in the NAcc and OT are critical in paternal behavior.","Parental behavior, Paternal behavior, Maternal behavior, Retrieval behavior, Oxytocin, CD38, Nucleus accumbens",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-41,2013
Tristetraprolin expression and microRNA-mediated regulation during simian immunodeficiency virus infection of the central nervous system,"Jonathan Liu1,, Jeanne M Sisk1,, Lucio Gama1,, Janice E Clements1,2,3 &, Kenneth W Witwer1",Kenneth W Witwer,kwitwer1@jhmi.edu,2013-09-02,"BackgroundThe RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) participates in normal post-transcriptional control of cytokine and chemokine gene expression, dysregulation of which contributes to the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of TTP has been described, including regulation by microRNA-29a. In the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV CNS disease, control of cytokine/chemokine expression coincides with the end of acute phase infection. This control is lost during progression to disease. In this study, we assessed TTP regulation and association with cytokine regulation in the brain during SIV infection.ResultsQuantitation of TTP expression over the course of SIV infection revealed downregulation of TTP during acute infection, maintenance of relatively low levels during asymptomatic phase, and increased expression only during late-stage CNS disease, particularly in association with severe disease. The ability of miR-29a to regulate TTP was confirmed, and evidence for additional miRNA targeters of TTP was found. However, increased miR-29a expression in brain was not found to be significantly negatively correlated with TTP. Similarly, increased TTP during late-stage disease was not associated with lower cytokine expression.ConclusionsTTP expression is regulated during SIV infection of the CNS. The lack of significant negative correlation of miR-29a and TTP expression levels suggests that while miR-29a may contribute to TTP regulation, additional factors are involved. Reduced TTP expression during acute infection is consistent with increased cytokine production during this phase of infection, but the increases in TTP observed during late-stage infection were insufficient to halt runaway cytokine levels. While antisense inhibitors of the post-transcriptional targeters of TTP identified here could conceivably be used further to augment TTP regulation of cytokines, it is possible that high levels of TTP are undesirable. Additional research is needed to characterize members of the miRNA/TTP/cytokine regulatory network and identify nodes that may be best targeted therapeutically to ameliorate the effects of chronic inflammation in retrovirus-associated CNS disease.","Cytokine, RNA-binding protein, Tristetraprolin, microRNA, Human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-40,2013

Amongst the sensors are the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of proteins that are involved in multiple neuronal signalling pathways. Each NCS protein has specific and overlapping targets and physiological functions and specificity is likely to be determined by structural features within the proteins. Common to the NCS proteins is the exposure of a hydrophobic groove, allowing target binding in the Ca2+-loaded form. Structural analysis of NCS protein complexes with target peptides has indicated common and distinct aspects of target protein interaction. Two key differences between NCS proteins are the size of the hydrophobic groove that is exposed for interaction and the role of their non-conserved C-terminal tails.ResultsWe characterised the role of NCS-1 in a temperature-dependent locomotion assay in C. elegans and identified a distinct phenotype in the ncs-1 null in which the worms do not show reduced locomotion at actually elevated temperature. Using rescue of this phenotype we showed that NCS-1 functions in AIY neurons. Structure/function analysis introducing single or double mutations within the hydrophobic groove based on information from characterised target complexes established that both N- and C-terminal pockets of the groove are functionally important and that deletion of the C-terminal tail of NCS-1 did not impair its ability to rescue.ConclusionsThe current work has allowed physiological assessment of suggestions from structural studies on the key structural features that underlie the interaction of NCS-1 with its target proteins. The results are consistent with the notion that full length of the hydrophobic groove is required for the regulatory interactions underlying NCS-1 function whereas the C-terminal tail of NCS-1 is not essential. This has allowed discrimination between two potential modes of interaction of NCS-1 with its targets.","Calcium signalling, Calcium binding proteins, C. elegans, NCS-1",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-39,2013

Homeostatic plasticity has often been investigated by assaying changes in spontaneous synaptic transmission resulting from chronic circuit inactivation. However, effects of inactivation on evoked transmission have been less frequently reported. Importantly, contributions from the effects of circuit inactivation and reactivation on synaptic efficacy have not been individuated.ResultsHere we show for developing hippocampal neurons in primary culture that chronic inactivation with TTX results in increased mean amplitude of miniature synaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not evoked synaptic currents (eEPSCs). However, changes in quantal properties of transmission, partially reflected in mEPSCs, accurately predicted higher-order statistical properties of eEPSCs. The classical prediction of homeostasis – increased strength of evoked transmission – was realized after explicit circuit reactivation, in the form of cells’ pairwise connection probability. In contrast, distributions of eEPSC amplitudes for control and inactivated-then-reactivated groups matched throughout.ConclusionsHomeostatic up-regulation of evoked synaptic transmission in developing hippocampal neurons in primary culture requires both the inactivation and reactivation stages, leading to a net increase in functional circuit connectivity.","Homeostasis, Metaplasticity, Quantal hypothesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-38,2013

Furthermore, prolonged increase in Ca2+ concentration leads to the auto-phosphorylation of αCaMKII at T286, maintaining the activation of αCaMKII even after Ca2+/CaM dissociation. Importantly, the active form of αCaMKII is thought to exhibit conformational change. In order to elucidate the relationships between the interaction of αCaMKII with CaM and the conformational change of αCaMKII, we generated molecular probes (YFP-αCaMKII with CFP-CaM and YFP-αCaMKII-CFP) and performed time-lapse imaging of the interaction with CaM and the conformational change, respectively, in living cells using FRET.ResultsThe interaction of YFP-αCaMKII with CFP-CaM and the conformational change of YFP-αCaMKII-CFP were induced simultaneously in response to increased concentrations of Ca2+. Consistent with previous predictions, high levels of Ca2+ signaling maintained the conformational change of YFP-αCaMKII-CFP at the time when CFP-CaM was released from YFP-αCaMKII. These observations indicated the transfer of αCaMKII conformational change from CaM-dependence to CaM-independence. Furthermore, analyses using αCaMKII mutants showed that phosphorylation at T286 and T305/306 played positive and negative roles, respectively, during in vivo interaction with CaM and further suggested that CaM-dependent and CaM-independent conformational changed forms displays similar but distinct structures.ConclusionsImportantly, these structual differences between CaM-dependent and -independent forms of αCaMKII may exhibit differential functions for αCaMKII, such as interactions with other molecules required for LTP and memory.

Identification of a single amino acid in GluN1 that is critical for glycine-primed internalization of NMDA receptors,"Lu Han1,2,, Verónica A Campanucci1,2,3,, James Cooke1,2 &, Michael W Salter1,2",Michael W Salter,mike.salter@utoronto.ca,2013-08-13,"BackgroundNMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels with essential roles in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity in the CNS. As co-receptors for glutamate and glycine, gating of the NMDA receptor/channel pore requires agonist binding to the glycine sites, as well as to the glutamate sites, on the ligand-binding domains of the receptor. In addition to channel gating, glycine has been found to prime NMDA receptors for internalization upon subsequent stimulation of glutamate and glycine sites.ResultsHere we address the key issue of identifying molecular determinants in the glycine-binding subunit, GluN1, that are essential for priming of NMDA receptors. We found that glycine treatment of wild-type NMDA receptors led to recruitment of the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), and subsequent internalization after activating the receptors by NMDA plus glycine. However, with a glycine-binding mutant of GluN1 – N710R/Y711R/E712A/A714L – we found that treating with glycine did not promote recruitment of AP-2 nor were glycine-treated receptors internalized when subsequently activated with NMDA plus glycine. Likewise, GluN1 carrying a single point mutation – A714L – did not prime upon glycine treatment. Importantly, both of the mutant receptors were functional, as stimulating with NMDA plus glycine evoked inward currents.ConclusionsThus, we have identified a single amino acid in GluN1 that is critical for priming of NMDA receptors by glycine. Moreover, we have demonstrated the principle that while NMDA receptor gating and priming share a common requirement for glycine binding, the molecular constraints in GluN1 for gating are distinct from those for priming.","NMDA Receptors, Glycine, Internalization, Endocytosis, Dynamin, GluN1, GluN2",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-36,2013

A dominant hypothesis attributes the neurotoxicity to accumulated substrates that are exempt from parkin-mediated degradation. Parkin substrates include two septins; SEPT4/CDCrel-2 which coaggregates with α-synuclein as Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease, and its closest homolog SEPT5/CDCrel-1/PNUTL1 whose overload with viral vector can rapidly eliminate dopamine neurons in rats. However, chronic effects of pan-neural overload of septins have never been examined in mammals. To address this, we established a line of transgenic mice that express the largest gene product SEPT454kDa via the prion promoter in the entire brain.ResultsHistological examination and biochemical quantification of SEPT4-associated proteins including α-synuclein and the dopamine transporter in the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons found no significant difference between Sept4Tg/+ and wild-type littermates. Thus, the hypothetical pathogenicity by the chronic overload of SEPT4 alone, if any, is insufficient to trigger neurodegenerative process in the mouse brain. Intriguingly, however, a systematic battery of behavioral tests revealed unexpected abnormalities in Sept4Tg/+ mice that include consistent attenuation of voluntary activities in distinct behavioral paradigms and altered social behaviors.ConclusionsTogether, these data indicate that septin dysregulations commonly found in postmortem human brains with Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders may be responsible for a subset of behavioral abnormalities in the patients.","Parkin, Septin, Transgenic mouse, Systematic behavioral screening",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-35,2013

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity is thought to be an important contributor to RGC death in these diseases. Native NMDARs are heterotetramers that consist of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, and GluN2 subunits (GluN2A–D) are major determinants of the pharmacological and biophysical properties of NMDARs. All NMDAR subunits are expressed in RGCs in the retina.

One of the brain regions most affected is the cerebellum, in which the number of granule cells (GCs) is markedly decreased. GCs process sensory information entering the cerebellum via mossy fibres and pass it on to Purkinje cells and inhibitory interneurons. How GCs transform incoming signals depends on their input–output relationship, which is adjusted by tonically active GABAA receptor channels.ResultsWe report that in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, in which cerebellar volume and GC number are decreased as in DS, the tonic GABAA receptor current in GCs is smaller than in wild-type mice and is less effective in moderating input resistance and raising the minimum current required for action potential firing. We also find that tonically active GABAA receptors curb the height and broaden the width of action potentials in wild-type GCs but not in Ts65Dn GCs. Single-cell real-time quantitative PCR reveals that these electrical differences are accompanied by decreased expression of the gene encoding the GABAA receptor β3 subunit but not genes coding for some of the other GABAA receptor subunits expressed in GCs (α1, α6, β2 and δ).ConclusionsWeaker moderation of excitability and action potential waveform in GCs of the Ts65Dn mouse by tonically active GABAA receptors is likely to contribute to atypical transfer of information through the cerebellum.

Both pain and rewards, however, have been shown to alter synaptic activities in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key component of the brain reward system. Mechanisms by which external stimuli regulate plasticity at NAc synapses are largely unexplored. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from the NAc receive excitatory glutamatergic inputs and modulatory dopaminergic and cholinergic inputs from a variety of cortical and subcortical structures. Glutamate inputs to the NAc arise primarily from prefrontal cortex, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and different glutamate projections provide distinct synaptic and ultimately behavioral functions. The family of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs 1–3) plays a key role in the uploading of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. VGLUT1-3 isoforms have distinct expression patterns in the brain, but the effects of external stimuli on their expression patterns have not been studied.ResultsIn this study, we use a sucrose self-administration paradigm for natural rewards, and spared nerve injury (SNI) model for chronic pain. We examine the levels of VGLUTs (1–3) in synaptoneurosomes of the NAc in these two behavioral models. We find that chronic pain leads to a decrease of VGLUT1, likely reflecting decreased projections from the cortex. Pain also decreases VGLUT3 levels, likely representing a decrease in projections from GABAergic, serotonergic, and/or cholinergic interneurons. In contrast, chronic consumption of sucrose increases VGLUT3 in the NAc, possibly reflecting an increase from these interneuron projections.ConclusionOur study shows that natural rewards and pain have distinct effects on the VGLUT expression pattern in the NAc, indicating that glutamate inputs to the NAc are differentially modulated by rewards and pain.","Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), Nucleus accumbens, Glutamate, Natural rewards, Pain",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-32,2013

Mutations of RNA binding proteins, including TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS), have been described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a devastating motor neuron disease, which progresses rapidly to a total loss of upper and lower motor neurons, with consciousness sustained. The aim of this study was to clarify the interaction of paraspeckles with ALS-associated RNA-binding proteins, and to identify increased occurrence of paraspeckles in the nucleus of ALS spinal motor neurons.ResultsIn situ hybridization (ISH) and ultraviolet cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were carried out to investigate interactions of NEAT1_2 lncRNA with ALS-associated RNA-binding proteins, and to test if paraspeckles form in ALS spinal motor neurons. As the results, TDP-43 and FUS/TLS were enriched in paraspeckles and bound to NEAT1_2 lncRNA directly. The paraspeckles were localized apart from the Cajal bodies, which were also known to be related to RNA metabolism. Analyses of 633 human spinal motor neurons in six ALS cases showed NEAT1_2 lncRNA was upregulated during the early stage of ALS pathogenesis. In addition, localization of NEAT1_2 lncRNA was identified in detail by electron microscopic analysis combined with ISH for NEAT1_2 lncRNA. The observation indicating specific assembly of NEAT1_2 lncRNA around the interchromatin granule-associated zone in the nucleus of ALS spinal motor neurons verified characteristic paraspeckle formation.ConclusionsNEAT1_2 lncRNA may act as a scaffold of RNAs and RNA binding proteins in the nuclei of ALS motor neurons, thereby modulating the functions of ALS-associated RNA-binding proteins during the early phase of ALS.

Consequently, practically all parameters and characteristics indicated that both GSK3 isoforms were regulated independently, but that they acted on the same physiological functions in learning and memory, in mobility and in behavior.ConclusionsGSK3α proved to be regulated independently from GSK3β, and to exert non-redundant physiological neurological functions in general behavior and in cognition.

Altered microRNA expression profile in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a role in the regulation of NFL mRNA levels,"Danae Campos-Melo1,, Cristian A Droppelmann1,, Zhongping He1,, Kathryn Volkening1,3 &, Michael J Strong1,2,3,4",Michael J Strong,Michael.Strong@schulich.uwo.ca,2013-05-24,"BackgroundAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, adult onset, fatal neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons. There is emerging evidence that alterations in RNA metabolism may be critical in the pathogenesis of ALS. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are key determinants of mRNA stability. Considering that miRNAs are increasingly being recognized as having a role in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, we decided to characterize the miRNA expression profile in spinal cord (SC) tissue in sporadic ALS (sALS) and controls. Furthermore, we performed functional analysis to identify a group of dysregulated miRNAs that could be responsible for the selective suppression of low molecular weight neurofilament (NFL) mRNA observed in ALS.ResultsUsing TaqMan arrays we analyzed 664 miRNAs and found that a large number of miRNAs are differentially expressed in ventral lumbar SC in sALS compared to controls. We observed that the majority of dysregulated miRNAs are down-regulated in sALS SC tissues. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that dysregulated miRNAs are linked with nervous system function and cell death. We used two prediction algorithms to develop a panel of miRNAs that have recognition elements within the human NFL mRNA 3′UTR, and then we performed functional analysis for these miRNAs. Our results demonstrate that three miRNAs that are dysregulated in sALS (miR-146a*, miR-524-5p and miR-582-3p) are capable of interacting with NFL mRNA 3′UTR in a manner that is consistent with the suppressed steady state mRNA levels observed in spinal motor neurons in ALS.ConclusionsThe miRNA expression profile is broadly altered in the SC in sALS. Amongst these is a group of dysregulated miRNAs directly regulate the NFL mRNA 3′UTR, suggesting a role in the selective suppression of NFL mRNA in the ALS spinal motor neuron neurofilamentous aggregate formation.","miRNA, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Neurofilament",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-26,2013

Serotonin (5-HT) type 7 receptors are expressed throughout the brain including the thalamus and hippocampus. Long-term (2–24 h) activation of 5-HT7 receptors promotes the expression of neuroprotective growth factor receptors, including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β receptors which can protect neurons against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity.ResultsIn contrast to long-term activation of 5-HT7 receptors, acute (5 min) treatment of isolated hippocampal neurons with the 5-HT7 receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) enhances NMDA-evoked peak currents and this increase in peak currents is blocked by the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, SB 269970. In hippocampal slices, acute 5-HT7 receptor activation increases NR1 NMDA receptor subunit phosphorylation and differentially alters the phosphorylation state of the NR2B and NR2A subunits.

An unexpected role of neuroligin-2 in regulating KCC2 and GABA functional switch,"Chicheng Sun1,, Lei Zhang1 &, Gong Chen1",Gong Chen,gongchen@psu.edu,2013-05-12,"BackgroundGABAA receptors are ligand-gated Cl- channels, and the intracellular Cl- concentration governs whether GABA function is excitatory or inhibitory. During early brain development, GABA undergoes functional switch from excitation to inhibition: GABA depolarizes immature neurons but hyperpolarizes mature neurons due to a developmental decrease of intracellular Cl- concentration. This GABA functional switch is mainly mediated by the up-regulation of KCC2, a potassium-chloride cotransporter that pumps Cl- outside neurons. However, the upstream factor that regulates KCC2 expression is unclear.ResultsWe report here that KCC2 is unexpectedly regulated by neuroligin-2 (NL2), a cell adhesion molecule specifically localized at GABAergic synapses. The expression of NL2 precedes that of KCC2 in early postnatal development. Upon knockdown of NL2, the expression level of KCC2 is significantly decreased, and GABA functional switch is significantly delayed during early development. Overexpression of shRNA-proof NL2 rescues both KCC2 reduction and delayed GABA functional switch induced by NL2 shRNAs. Moreover, NL2 appears to be required to maintain GABA inhibitory function even in mature neurons, because knockdown NL2 reverses GABA action to excitatory. Gramicidin-perforated patch clamp recordings confirm that NL2 directly regulates the GABA equilibrium potential. We further demonstrate that knockdown of NL2 decreases dendritic spines through down-regulating KCC2.ConclusionsOur data suggest that in addition to its conventional role as a cell adhesion molecule to regulate GABAergic synaptogenesis, NL2 also regulates KCC2 to modulate GABA functional switch and even glutamatergic synapses. Therefore, NL2 may serve as a master regulator in balancing excitation and inhibition in the brain.","Neuroligin-2, KCC2, GABA, Intracellular chloride homeostasis, Synapse formation, Excitation-inhibition balance",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-23,2013

Dysregulation of NMDARs is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Native NMDARs are heteromultimeric protein complexes consisting of NR1 and NR2 subunits. NR2 subunits (NR2A–D) are the major determinants of the functional properties of NMDARs. Most research has focused on NR2A- and/or NR2B-containing receptors. A recent study demonstrated that NR2C- and/or NR2D-containing NMDARs are the primary targets of memantine, a drug that is widely prescribed to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Our laboratory demonstrated that memantine prevents the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in GLAST glutamate transporter knockout mice, a model of normal tension glaucoma (NTG), suggesting that NR2D-containing receptors may be involved in RGC loss in NTG.ResultsHere we demonstrate that NR2D deficiency attenuates RGC loss in GLAST-deficient mice. Furthermore, Dock3, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, binds to the NR2D C-terminal domain and reduces the surface expression of NR2D, thereby protecting RGCs from excitotoxicity.ConclusionsThese results suggest that NR2D is involved in the degeneration of RGCs induced by excitotoxicity, and that the interaction between NR2D and Dock3 may have a neuroprotective effect.

Recent work suggested that tonic inhibition may also play a role in regulating epileptogenesis, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood.ResultsWe employed molecular and pharmacological tools to investigate the role of tonic inhibition during epileptogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We overexpressed two distinct subtypes of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, α5β3γ2 and α6β3δ receptors, in cultured hippocampal neurons. We demonstrated that overexpression of both α5β3γ2 and α6β3δ receptors enhanced tonic inhibition and reduced epileptiform activity in vitro. We then showed that injection of THIP (5 μM), a selective agonist for extrasynaptic GABAA receptors at low concentration, into rat brain also suppressed epileptiform burst activity and behavioral seizures in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered that low concentration of THIP had no effect on GABAergic synaptic transmission and did not affect the basal level of action potentials, but significantly inhibited high frequency neuronal activity induced by epileptogenic agents.ConclusionsOur studies suggest that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors play an important role in controlling hyperexcitatory activity, such as that during epileptogenesis, but a less prominent role in modulating a low level of basal activity.

However, the mechanism by which DISC1 regulates interneuron development remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed interneuron histology in the Disc1-L100P single point mutation mouse, that was previously shown to have behavioral abnormalities and cortical developmental defects related to schizophrenia.ResultsWe sought to determine whether a Disc1-L100P point mutation in the mouse would alter interneuron density and location. First, we examined interneuron position in the developing mouse cortex during embryonic days 14–16 as an indicator of interneuron tangential migration, and found striking migration deficits in Disc1-L100P mutants.

Treatment regimens usually consist of high doses of DEX for several weeks, notably during a critical period of brain development. Therefore, there is some concern about adverse effects of this clinical practice on fetal brain development. In this study, using a clinically relevant rat model, we examined the impact of neonatal DEX treatment on subsequent brain injury due to an episode of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI).ResultsWe found that a 3-day tapering course (0.5, 0.3 and 0.1 mg/kg) of DEX treatment in rat pups on postnatal days 1–3 (P1-3) exacerbated HI-induced brain injury on P7 by a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanism. The aggravating effect of neonatal DEX treatment on HI-induced brain injury was correlated with decreased glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1)-mediated glutamate reuptake. The expression levels of mRNA and protein of GLT-1 were significantly reduced by neonatal DEX treatment. We also found that the administration of β-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone increased GLT-1 protein expression and significantly reduced HI-induced brain injury in neonatal DEX-treated rats.ConclusionsThese results suggest that early DEX exposure may lead the neonatal brain to be more vulnerable to subsequent HI injury, which can be ameliorated by administrating ceftriaxone.","Glutamate Uptake, Ceftriaxone Treatment, Common Carotid Artery Ligation, GLAST mRNA, Glutamate Transporter Subtype",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-18,2013

We previously showed that the selective ablation of striatal neurons in the adult brain impairs the long-term, but not short-term, memory for auditory fear conditioning with a lower-intensity footshock. This finding raises an intriguing possibility that long-term auditory fear memory may be consolidated in the striatum.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the freezing responses between two groups of mice subjected to paired and unpaired conditioning, indicating that the auditory fear conditioning with a lower-intensity footshock is an associative learning. Post-conditioning infusion of NMDA receptor inhibitors into the striatum suppressed the consolidation of auditory fear memory when mice were conditioned with a low-intensity footshock. Furthermore, intra-striatum infusion of protein synthesis blocker anisomycin immediately or 1 h after the conditioning prevented the formation of auditory fear memory. On the other hand, the infusion of anisomycin 3 h after conditioning exerted little effect on the auditory fear conditioning, consistent with the presence of a critical time window of protein synthesis for memory consolidation.ConclusionsThese results suggest that NMDA receptors and de novo protein synthesis in the striatum are crucial for the consolidation of auditory fear memory formed with a low-intensity unconditioned stimulus.","Memory, Striatum, Auditory fear conditioning, NMDA receptor, Protein synthesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-17,2013

Growing evidence suggests that SNAP-25 is involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy. Recently, increases in anxiety-related behaviors and epilepsy have been observed in SNAP-25 knock-in (KI) mice, which have a single amino acid substitution of Ala for Ser187. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the abnormalities in this mutant remain unknown.ResultsIn this study, we found that a significant number of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells was histologically and electrophysiologically similar to immature DG neurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult mutants, a phenomenon termed the “immature DG” (iDG). SNAP-25 KI mice and other mice possessing the iDG phenotype, i.e., alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II heterozygous mice, Schnurri-2 knockout mice, and mice treated with the antidepressant fluoxetine, showed similar molecular expression patterns, with over 100 genes similarly altered. A working memory deficit was also identified in mutant mice during a spontaneous forced alternation task using a modified T-maze, a behavioral task known to be dependent on hippocampal function. Chronic treatments with the antiepileptic drug valproate abolished the iDG phenotype and the working memory deficit in mutants.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the substitution of Ala for Ser187 in SNAP-25 induces the iDG phenotype, which can also be caused by epilepsy, and led to a severe working memory deficit.

Recent findings suggest that the central amygdala (CeA) plays an active role in the acquisition of fear learning. However, little is known about the synaptic properties of the CeA in fear learning. The capsular part of the central amygdala (CeC) receives direct nociceptive information from the external part of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPB), as well as highly processed polymodal signals from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). Therefore, we focused on CeC as a convergence point for polymodal BLA signals and nociceptive lPB signals, and explored the synaptic regulation of these pathways in fear conditioning.ResultsIn this study, we show that fear conditioning results in synaptic potentiation in both lPB-CeC and BLA-CeC synapses. This potentiation is dependent on associative fear learning, rather than on nociceptive or sensory experience, or fear memory retrieval. The synaptic weight of the lPB-CeC and BLA-CeC pathways is correlated in fear-conditioned mice, suggesting that fear learning may induce activity-dependent heterosynaptic interactions between lPB-CeC and BLA-CeC pathways. This synaptic potentiation is associated with both postsynaptic and presynaptic changes in the lPB-CeC and BLA-CeC synapses.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the CeC may provide an important locus of Pavlovian association, integrating direct nociceptive signals with polymodal sensory signals. In addition to the well-established plasticity of the lateral amygdala, the multi-step nature of this association system contributes to the highly orchestrated tuning of fear learning.","Central amygdala, Fear conditioning, Synapse, Plasticity, Potentiation, Mouse, Nociception",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-11,2013
The CaMKII/NMDAR complex as a molecular memory,"Magdalena Sanhueza1 &, John Lisman2",John Lisman,Lisman@brandeis.edu,2013-02-14,"CaMKII is a major synaptic protein that is activated during the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by the Ca2+ influx through NMDARs. This activation is required for LTP induction, but the role of the kinase in the maintenance of LTP is less clear. Elucidating the mechanisms of maintenance may provide insights into the molecular processes that underlie the stability of stored memories. In this brief review, we will outline the criteria for evaluating an LTP maintenance mechanism. The specific hypothesis evaluated is that LTP is maintained by the complex of activated CaMKII with the NMDAR. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is substantial, but further experiments are required, notably to determine the time course and persistence of complex after LTP induction. Additional work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. It has been proposed by Frey and Morris that late LTP involves the setting of a molecular tag during LTP induction, which subsequently allows the activated synapse to capture the proteins responsible for late LTP. However, the molecular processes by which this leads to the structural growth that underlies late LTP are completely unclear. Based on known binding reactions, we suggest the first molecularly specific version of tag/capture hypothesis: that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, once formed, serves as a tag, which then leads to a binding cascade involving densin, delta-catenin, and N-cadherin (some of which are newly synthesized). Delta-catenin binds AMPA-binding protein (ABP), leading to the LTP-induced increase in AMPA channel content. The addition of postsynaptic N-cadherin, and the complementary increase on the presynaptic side, leads to a trans-synaptically coordinated increase in synapse size (and more release sites). It is suggested that synaptic strength is stored stably through the combined actions of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex and N-cadherin dimers. These N-cadherin pairs have redundant storage that could provide informational stability in a manner analogous to the base-pairing in DNA.","Basal Transmission, Mutation L1298A, AMPA Channel, Synapse Size, CaMKII Holoenzyme",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-10,2013

In addition to functioning as neurotransmitter receptors to modulate synaptic activity, pathological mGluR5 signaling has been implicated in a number of disease processes including Fragile X, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, and drug addiction. The expression of mGluR5 in astrocytes has been shown to be increased in several acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, but little is known about the functional relevance of mGluR5 up-regulation in astrocytes following injury.ResultsIn the current study, we investigated primary mouse cortical astrocyte cell death in response to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and found that OGD induced both necrotic and apoptotic cell death of astrocytes. OGD resulted in an increase in astrocytic mGluR5 protein expression, inositol phosphate formation and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, but only inositol phosphate formation was blocked with the mGluR5 selective antagonist MPEP. Cortical astrocytes derived from mGluR5 knockout mice exhibited resistance to OGD-stimulated apoptosis, but a lack of mGluR5 expression did not confer protection against necrotic cell death. The antagonism of the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor also reduced apoptotic cell death in wild-type astrocytes, but did not provide any additional protection to astrocytes derived from mGluR5 null mice. Moreover, the disruption of Homer protein interactions with mGluR5 also reduced astrocyte apoptosis.ConclusionTaken together these observations indicated that mGluR5 up-regulation contributed selectively to the apoptosis of astrocytes via the activation of phospholipase C and the release of calcium from intracellular stores as well as via the association with Homer proteins.","Astrocyte, Metabotropic glutamate receptor, Cell death, Inositol phosphate, Oxygen glucose deprivation, Homer",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-9,2013

This may be partly explained by the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding molecular entities involved in opioid metabolism and receptor activation. This paper describes the investigation of SNPs in three genes that have a functional impact on the opioid response: OPRM1, which codes for the μ-opioid receptor; ABCB1 for the ATP-binding cassette B1 transporter enzyme; and the calcium channel complex subunit CACNA2D2. The genotyping was combined with an analysis of plasma levels of the opioid peptide β-endorphin in 80 well-defined patients with chronic low back pain scheduled for spinal fusion surgery, and with differential sensitivity to the opioid analgesic remifentanil. This patient group was compared with 56 healthy controls.ResultsThe plasma β-endorphin levels were significantly higher in controls than in pain patients.A higher incidence of opioid-related side effects and sex differences was found in patients with the minor allele of the ABCB1 gene. Further, a correlation between increased opioid sensitivity and the major CACNA2D2 allele was confirmed. A tendency of a relationship between opioid sensitivity and the minor allele of OPRM1 was also found.ConclusionsAlthough the sample cohort in this study was limited to 80 patients it appears that it was possible to observe significant correlations between polymorphism in relevant genes and various items related to pain sensitivity and opioid response. Of particular interest is the new finding of a correlation between increased opioid sensitivity and the major CACNA2D2 allele.

The decreased astrocytic ‘protection’ of the synapses facilitated glutamate ‘spillover’, which was reflected by prolonged glutamate transporter currents in stratum radiatum astrocytes and enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to burst stimulation. These mice also exhibited behavioral impairments in spatial reference memory and remote contextual fear memory, in which hippocampal circuits are involved.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that IP3-mediated astrocytic Ca2+ signaling correlates with the formation of functional tripartite synapses in the hippocampus.","Astrocyte, Calcium, Synapse, Neuron-glia interaction",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-6,2013

Our recent study demonstrated that astrocytes release glutamate upon GPCR activation via Ca2+ activated anion channel, Bestrophin-1 (Best1). The target of Best1-mediated astrocytic glutamate has been shown to be the neuronal NMDA receptors (NMDAR). However, whether it targets synaptically or extra-synaptically localized NMDAR is not known.FindingsWe recorded spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) from CA1 pyramidal cells to test whether Best1-mediated astrocytic glutamate targets synaptic NMDAR. An agonist of protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) was used to induce astrocytic Ca2+ increase and glutamate release. Firstly, we found that activation of PAR1 and subsequent release of glutamate from astrocyte does not alone increase the frequency of mEPSCs. Secondly, we found that mEPSC rise time is variable depending on the different electrotonic distances from the somatic recording site to the synaptic region where each mEPSC occurs. Two subgroups of mEPSC from CA1 pyramidal neuron by rise time were selected and analyzed. One group is fast rising mEPSCs with a rise time of 1 ~ 5 ms, representing synaptic activities arising from proximal dendrites. The other group is slowly rising mEPSCs with a rise time of 5 ~ 10 ms, representing synaptic events arising from glutamate release at synapses located in the distal dendrites. We used cell-type specific Best1 gene silencing system by Cre-loxP cleavage to dissociate the effect of neuronal and astrocytic Best1. Astrocytic Best1-mediated glutamate release by PAR1 activation did not affect decay kinetics, frequency, and amplitude of fast rising mEPSC. In contrast, PAR1 activation resulted in an NMDA receptor component to be present on slowly rising mEPSC, but did not alter frequency or amplitude.ConclusionsOur results indicate that astrocytic glutamate via Best1 channel targets and activates synaptic NMDARs.","Astrocyte, Bestrophin-1, mEPSC, NMDAR",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-4,2013

However, the reasons for this difference and whether it involves the survival and/or fate of grafted cells under these two conditions remain unclear. To address this question, NS/PC transplantation was performed after contusive spinal cord injury in adult mice at the sub-acute and chronic phases.ResultsQuantitative analyses using bio-imaging, which can noninvasively detect surviving grafted cells in living animals, revealed no significant difference in the survival rate of grafted cells between the sub-acute and chronic transplantation groups. Additionally, immunohistology revealed no significant difference in the differentiation phenotypes of grafted cells between the two groups. Microarray analysis revealed no significant differences in the expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines or growth factors, which affect the survival and/or fate of grafted cells, in the injured spinal cord between the sub-acute and chronic phases. By contrast, the distribution of chronically grafted NS/PCs was restricted compared to NS/PCs grafted at the sub-acute phase because a more prominent glial scar located around the lesion epicenter enclosed the grafted cells. Furthermore, microarray and histological analysis revealed that the infiltration of macrophages, especially M2 macrophages, which have anti-inflammatory role, was significantly higher at the sub-acute phase than the chronic phase. Ultimately, NS/PCs that were transplanted in the sub-acute phase, but not the chronic phase, promoted functional recovery compared with the vehicle control group.ConclusionsThe extent of glial scar formation and the characteristics of inflammation is the most remarkable difference in the injured spinal cord microenvironment between the sub-acute and chronic phases.

We studied this subject in the barrel cortices from whiskers-trimmed mice vs. controls. After whisker trimming for a week, the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons and the transmission of excitatory synapses were upregulated in the barrel cortex, but inhibitory neurons and GABAergic synapses were downregulated. The morphological analyses indicated that the number of processes and spines in pyramidal neurons increased, whereas the processes of GABAergic neurons decreased in the barrel cortex. The upregulation of excitatory neurons and the downregulation of inhibitory neurons boost the activity of network neurons in the barrel cortex to be high levels, which prevent the loss of their functions and enhances their sensitivity to sensory inputs.

Acid-sensing ion channels: trafficking and synaptic function,Xiang-ming Zha1,Xiang-ming Zha,zha@southalabama.edu,2013-01-02,"Extracellular acidification occurs in the brain with elevated neural activity, increased metabolism, and neuronal injury. This reduction in pH can have profound effects on brain function because pH regulates essentially every single biochemical reaction. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that Nature evolves a family of proteins, the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), to sense extracellular pH reduction. ASICs are proton-gated cation channels that are mainly expressed in the nervous system. In recent years, a growing body of literature has shown that acidosis, through activating ASICs, contributes to multiple diseases, including ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and seizures. In addition, ASICs play a key role in fear and anxiety related psychiatric disorders. Several recent reviews have summarized the importance and therapeutic potential of ASICs in neurological diseases, as well as the structure-function relationship of ASICs. However, there is little focused coverage on either the basic biology of ASICs or their contribution to neural plasticity.

Slight compression and chemical effects of the chromic gut suture on the portion of the infraorbital nerve contacted cause mild nerve trauma. Nerve edema is observed in the contacting infraorbital nerve bundle as well as macrophage infiltration in the trigeminal ganglia. Centrally in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, increased immunoreactivity for an activated microglial marker is evident (OX42, postoperative day 70). Mechanical thresholds of the affected whisker pad are significantly decreased on day 3 after chromic gut suture placement, persisting at least 10 weeks.

While multiple domains enable the PSD-MAGUKs to bind various ligands, the contribution of each PDZ domain to synaptic organization and function is not fully understood. Here, we focused on the PDZ1/2 domains of PSD-95 that bind NMDA-type receptors, and studied the specific roles of the ligand binding of these domains in the assembly of PSD proteins, synaptic properties of hippocampal neurons, and behavior, using ligand binding-deficient PSD-95 cDNA knockin (KI) mice.ResultsThe KI mice showed decreased accumulation of mutant PSD-95, PSD-93 and AMPA receptor subunits in the PSD fraction of the hippocampus. In the hippocampal CA1 region of young KI mice, basal synaptic efficacy was reduced and long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced with intact long-term depression. In adult KI mice, there was no significant change in the magnitude of LTP in CA1, but robustly enhanced LTP was induced at the medial perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses, suggesting that PSD-95 has an age- and subregion-dependent role. In a battery of behavioral tests, KI mice showed markedly abnormal anxiety-like behavior, impaired spatial reference and working memory, and impaired remote memory and pattern separation in fear conditioning test.ConclusionsThese findings reveal that PSD-95 including its ligand binding of the PDZ1/2 domains controls the synaptic clustering of PSD-MAGUKs and AMPA receptors, which may have an essential role in regulating hippocampal synaptic transmission, plasticity, and hippocampus-dependent behavior.","PSD-MAGUK, Synaptic clustering, PDZ domain, PSD-95, Synaptic transmission, Dentate gyrus, Behavioral test battery",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-43,2012

Our understandings of molecular and cellular mechanisms that link mechanosensation with the changes in moving direction, however, remain limited.ResultsIn this study, we investigate the control of movement adjustment in Drosophila. In response to gentle touch at the anterior segments, Drosophila larvae reorient and select a new direction for forward movement. The extent of change in moving direction is correlated with the intensity of tactile stimuli. Sensation of gentle touch requires chordotonal organs and class IV da neurons.

Modulation of medial prefrontal cortical activity using in vivo recordings and optogenetics,"Guangchen Ji1 &, Volker Neugebauer1",Volker Neugebauer,voneugeb@utmb.edu,2012-10-08,"BackgroundThe medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) serves major executive functions. mPFC output to subcortical brain areas such as the amygdala controls emotional processing and plays an important role in fear extinction. Impaired mPFC function correlates with extinction deficits in anxiety disorders such as PTSD and with cognitive decision-making deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders and persistent pain. Controlling mPFC output is a desirable therapeutic goal in neuropsychiatric disorders but functional differences of cell types (pyramidal cells and interneurons) and regions (infralimbic and prelimbic) represent a challenge. This electrophysiological study used optogenetics for the cell- and region-specific modulation of mPFC pyramidal output in the intact anesthetized animal.ResultsExtracellular single-unit recordings were made from infralimbic (IL) pyramidal cells, IL interneurons and prelimbic (PL) pyramidal cells 2–3 weeks after intra-IL injection of a viral vector encoding channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) under the control of the CaMKII promoter (rAAV5/CaMKIIa-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP) or a control vector that lacked the ChR2 sequence (rAAV5/CaMKIIa-EYFP). Optical stimulation with laser-generated blue light pulses delivered through an optical fiber to the IL increased spontaneous and evoked action potential firing of ChR2 expressing IL pyramidal cells but had no effect on IL interneurons that were distinguished from pyramidal cells based on their higher firing rate and shorter spike duration. Optical activation of IL pyramidal cells also inhibited PL pyramidal cells, suggesting that IL output controls PL output. The effects were light intensity-dependent and reversible. Confocal microscopy confirmed ChR2-EYFP or control vector expression in mPFC pyramidal cells but not in GABAergic cells.ConclusionsThe novelty of our study is the analysis of optogenetic effects on background and evoked activity of defined cell types in different mPFC regions.

PARK2 iPSC-derived neurons showed increased oxidative stress and enhanced activity of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. iPSC-derived neurons, but not fibroblasts or iPSCs, exhibited abnormal mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial homeostasis. Although PARK2 patients rarely exhibit Lewy body (LB) formation with an accumulation of α-synuclein, α-synuclein accumulation was observed in the postmortem brain of one of the donor patients. This accumulation was also seen in the iPSC-derived neurons in the same patient.ConclusionsThus, pathogenic changes in the brain of a PARK2 patient were recapitulated using iPSC technology.

Axonal swellings such as globules and spheroids are a distinct feature of axonopathy and our recent study showed that transgenic (tg) mice expressing DLB-linked P123H β-synuclein (P123H βS) were characterized by P123H βS-immunoreactive axonal swellings (P123H βS-globules). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate α-synuclein (αS)-immunoreactive axonal swellings (αS-globules) in the brains of tg mice expressing human wild-type αS and to compare them with the globules in P123H βS tg mice.ResultsIn αS tg mice, αS-globules were formed in an age-dependent manner in various brain regions, including the thalamus and basal ganglia. These globules were composed of autophagosome-like membranous structures and were reminiscent of P123H βS-globules in P123H βS tg mice. In the αS-globules, frequent clustering and deformation of mitochondria were observed. These changes were associated with oxidative stress, based on staining of nitrated αS and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). In accord with the absence of mitochondria in the P123H βS-globules, staining of nitrated αS and 4-HNE in these globules was weaker than that for αS-globules. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the PARK8 of familial PD, was detected exclusively in αS-globules, suggesting a specific role of this molecule in these globules.ConclusionsLysosomal pathology was similarly observed for both αS- and P123H βS-globules, while oxidative stress was associated with the αS-globules, and to a lesser extent with the P123H βS-globules. Other pathologies, such as mitochondrial alteration and LRRK2 accumulation, were exclusively detected for αS-globules. Collectively, both αS- and P123H βS-globules were formed through similar but distinct pathogenic mechanisms.

However activity-dependent form of GABA excitation in cortical neurons has not been observed. Here we report that after an intense electrical stimulation adult cortical neurons displayed a transient GABA excitation that lasted for about 30s.ResultsWhole-cell patch recordings were performed to evaluate the effects of briefly applied GABA on pyramidal neurons in adult rodent sensorimotor cortical slice before and after 1 s, 20 Hz suprathreshold electrical stimulation of the junction between layer 6 and the underlying white matter (L6/WM stimulation). Immediately after L6/WM stimulation, GABA puffs produced neuronal depolarization in the center of the column-shaped region. However, both prior to or 30s after stimulation GABA puffs produced hyperpolarization of neurons. 2-photon imaging in neurons infected with adenovirus carrying a chloride sensor Clomeleon revealed that GABA induced depolarization is due to an increase in [Cl-]i after stimulation. To reveal the spatial extent of excitatory action of GABA, isoguvacine, a GABAA receptors agonist, was applied right after stimulation while monitoring the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in pyramidal neurons. Isoguvacine induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in pyramidal neurons especially in the center of the column but not in the peripheral regions of the column.

Memory maintenance by PKMζ — an evolutionary perspective,Todd Charlton Sacktor1,Todd Charlton Sacktor,tsacktor@downstate.edu,2012-09-18,"Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by persistent modifications of synaptic transmission within the neural circuits that mediate behavior. Thus, long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely studied as a potential physiological basis for the persistent enhancement of synaptic strength that might sustain memory. Whereas the molecular mechanisms that initially induce LTP have been extensively characterized, the mechanisms that persistently maintain the potentiation have not. Recently, however, a candidate molecular mechanism linking the maintenance of LTP and the storage of long-term memory has been identified. The persistent activity of the autonomously active, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoform, PKMζ, is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP. Furthermore, blocking PKMζ activity by pharmacological or dominant negative inhibitors disrupts previously stored long-term memories in a variety of neural circuits, including spatial and trace memories in the hippocampus, aversive memories in the basolateral amygdala, appetitive memories in the nucleus accumbens, habit memory in the dorsal lateral striatum, and elementary associations, extinction, and skilled sensorimotor memories in the neocortex. During LTP and memory formation, PKMζ is synthesized de novo as a constitutively active kinase. This molecular mechanism for memory storage is evolutionarily conserved. PKMζ formation through new protein synthesis likely originated in early vertebrates ~500 million years ago during the Cambrian period. Other mechanisms for forming persistently active PKM from aPKC are found in invertebrates, and inhibiting this atypical PKM disrupts long-term memory in the invertebrate model systems Drosophila melanogaster and Aplysia californica. Conversely, overexpressing PKMζ enhances memory in flies and rodents. PKMζ persistently enhances synaptic strength by maintaining increased numbers of AMPA receptors at postsynaptic sites, a mechanism that might have evolved from the general function of aPKC in trafficking membrane proteins to the apical compartment of polarized cells. This mechanism of memory may have had adaptive advantages because it is both stable and reversible, as demonstrated by the downregulation of experience-dependent, long-term increases in PKMζ after extinction and reconsolidation blockade that attenuate learned behavior. Thus, PKMζ, the “working end” of LTP, is a component of an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism for the persistent, yet flexible storage of long-term memory.","PKM zeta, PKMzeta, LTP, Memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-31,2012

Mercury-induced neuronal degeneration is thought to invoke glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of various mercury concentrations (including pathological levels present in human plasma or cerebrospinal fluid) on cultured, rat cortical neurons.ResultsWe found that inorganic mercuric chloride (HgCl2 –at 0.025 to 25 μM) not only caused neuronal degeneration but also perturbed neuronal excitability. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of pyramidal neurons revealed that HgCl2 not only enhanced the amplitude and frequency of synaptic, inward currents, but also increased spontaneous synaptic potentials followed by sustained membrane depolarization. HgCl2 also triggered sustained, 2–5 fold rises in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The observed increases in neuronal activity and [Ca2+]i were substantially reduced by the application of MK 801, a non-competitive antagonist of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Importantly, our study further shows that a pre incubation or co-application of MK 801 prevents HgCl2-induced reduction of cell viability and a disruption of β-tubulin.ConclusionsCollectively, our data show that HgCl2-induced toxic effects on central neurons are triggered by an over-activation of NMDA receptors, leading to cytoskeleton instability.","Mercury Chloride, Rat cortical neurons, Toxicity, MK 801, NMDA receptor, Excitotoxicity, Cytoskeleton",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-30,2012

The olfactory lobes are divided into cone-shaped synaptic areas, the olfactory glomeruli where afferents interact with local olfactory interneurons and olfactory projection neurons. The local olfactory interneurons display a large diversity of neurotransmitter phenotypes including biogenic amines and neuropeptides. Furthermore, the malacostracan olfactory glomeruli are regionalized into cap, subcap, and base regions and these compartments are defined by the projection patterns of the afferent olfactory receptor neurons, the local olfactory interneurons, and the olfactory projection neurons. We wanted to know how neurons expressing A-type allatostatins (A-ASTs; synonym dip-allatostatins) integrate into this system, a large family of neuropeptides that share the C-terminal motif –YX FGLamide.ResultsWe used an antiserum that was raised against the A-type Diploptera punctata (Dip)-allatostatin I to analyse the distribution of this peptide in the brain of a terrestrial hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus (Anomura, Coenobitidae). Allatostatin A-like immunoreactivity (ASTir) was widely distributed in the animal’s brain, including the visual system, central complex and olfactory system. We focussed our analysis on the central olfactory pathway in which ASTir was abundant in the primary processing centers, the olfactory lobes, and also in the secondary centers, the hemiellipsoid bodies. In the olfactory lobes, we further explored the spatial relationship of olfactory interneurons with ASTir to interneurons that synthesize RFamide-like peptides. We found that these two peptides are present in distinct populations of local olfactory interneurons and that their synaptic fields within the olfactory glomeruli are also mostly distinct.ConclusionsWe discuss our findings against the background of the known neurotransmitter complexity in the crustacean olfactory pathway and summarize what is now about the neuronal connectivity in the olfactory glomeruli. A-type allatostatins, in addition to their localization in protocerebral brain areas, seem to be involved in modulating the olfactory signal at the level of the deutocerebrum. They contribute to the complex local circuits within the crustacean olfactory glomeruli the connectivity within which as yet is completely unclear. Because the glomeruli of C. clypeatus display a distinct pattern of regionalization, their olfactory systems form an ideal model to explore the functional relevance of glomerular compartments and diversity of local olfactory interneurons for olfactory processing in crustaceans.","Coenobita clypeatus, Hermit crab, Olfactory lobe, Central complex, Neuropeptide, Immunhistochemistry, Allatostatin",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-29,2012

How the synapse dynamics quantitatively regulates the encoding of postsynaptic digital spikes remains unclear. We investigated this question at unitary glutamatergic synapses on cortical GABAergic neurons, especially the quantitative influences of release probability on synapse dynamics and neuronal encoding. Glutamate release probability and synaptic strength are proportionally upregulated by presynaptic sequential spikes. The upregulation of release probability and the efficiency of probability-driven synaptic facilitation are strengthened by elevating presynaptic spike frequency and Ca2+. The upregulation of release probability improves spike capacity and timing precision at postsynaptic neuron.

Probing the mechanisms of such impairment may provide much needed means of diagnosis and therapeutic intervention at an early, pre-dementia, stage. Prior to the onset of significant neurodegeneration, the structural and functional integrity of synapses in mnemonic circuitry is severely compromised in the presence of amyloidosis. This review examines recent evidence evaluating the role of amyloid-ß protein (Aβ) in causing rapid disruption of synaptic plasticity and memory impairment. We evaluate the relative importance of different sizes and conformations of Aβ, including monomer, oligomer, protofibril and fibril. We pay particular attention to recent controversies over the relevance to the pathophysiology of AD of different water soluble Aβ aggregates and the importance of cellular prion protein in mediating their effects. Current data are consistent with the view that both low-n oligomers and larger soluble assemblies present in AD brain, some of them via a direct interaction with cellular prion protein, cause synaptic memory failure. At the two extremes of aggregation, monomers and fibrils appear to act in vivo both as sources and sinks of certain metastable conformations of soluble aggregates that powerfully disrupt synaptic plasticity. The same principle appears to apply to other synaptotoxic amyloidogenic proteins including tau, α-synuclein and prion protein.","Amyloidogenic proteins, Long-term potentiation, Long-term depression, Alzheimer’s disease, Neurodegenerative diseases, α-synuclein oligomers, PrP oligomers",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-25,2012

We have now investigated the effect of a prenatal immune challenge on brain development in the offspring. Pregnant rats were treated with the double-stranded RNA polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C); 10 mg/kg) which mimics immune activation occurring after activation of Toll-like receptors-3 (TLR3) by viral infection. Injections were made in late gestation (embryonic days E14, E16 and E18), after which parturition proceeded naturally and the young were allowed to develop up to the time of weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21). The brains of these animals were then removed to assess the expression of 13 different neurodevelopmental molecules by immunoblotting.ResultsMeasurement of cytokine levels in the maternal blood 5 hours after an injection of poly(I:C) showed significantly increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), confirming immune activation. In the P21 offspring, significant changes were detected in the expression of GluN1 subunits of NMDA receptors, with no difference in GluN2A or GluN2B subunits or the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 and no change in the levels of the related small GTPases RhoA or RhoB, or the NMDA receptor modulator EphA4.

Cholecystokinin enhances visceral pain-related affective memory via vagal afferent pathway in rats,"Bing Cao1,, Xu Zhang1,, Ni Yan1,, Shengliang Chen2 &, Ying Li1",Ying Li,yingli@cityu.edu.hk,2012-06-09,"BackgroundPain contains both sensory and affective dimensions. Using a rodent visceral pain assay that combines the colorectal distension (CRD) model with the conditioned place avoidance (CPA) paradigms, we measured a learned behavior that directly reflects the affective component of visceral pain, and showed that perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) activation is critical for memory processing involved in long-term visceral affective state and prediction of aversive stimuli by contextual cue. Progress has been made and suggested that activation of vagal afferents plays a role in the behavioral control nociception and memory storage processes.In human patients, electrical vagus nerve stimulation enhanced retention of verbal learning performance. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK), which is a gastrointestinal hormone released during feeding, has been shown to enhance memory retention. Mice access to food immediately after training session enhanced memory retention. It has been well demonstrated that CCK acting on vagal afferent fibers mediates various physiological functions. We hypothesize that CCK activation of vagal afferent enhances visceral pain-related affective memory.ResultsIn the presented study, infusion of CCK-8 at physiological concentration combining with conditional training significantly increased the CRD-induced CPA scores, and enhanced the pain affective memory retention. In contrast, CCK had no effect on CPA induced by non-nociceptive aversive stimulus (U69,593). The physiological implications were further strengthened by the similar effects observed in the rats with duodenal infusion of 5% peptone, which has been shown to induce increases in plasma CCK levels. CCK-8 receptor antagonist CR-1409 or perivagal application of capsaicin abolished the effect of CCK on aversive visceral pain memory, which was consistent with the notion that vagal afferent modulates affective aspects of visceral pain. CCK does not change the nociceptive response (visceral pain sensitivity) and anterior cingulate cortex neuronal responses to CRD.ConclusionCCK activating vagal afferent C fibers enhances memory consolidation and retention involved in long-term visceral negative affective state. Thus, in a number of gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, nutrient content may contribute to painful visceral perception by enhancing visceral aversive memory via acts on vagal afferent pathway.","Cholecystokinin, Conditioned place avoidance, Visceral pain, Visceral aversive memory, Anterior cingulate cortex, Vagal afferent pathway",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-19,2012
Gabapentin reduces CX3CL1 signaling and blocks spinal microglial activation in monoarthritic rats,"Jia-Le Yang1,, Bo Xu2,, Shuang-Shuang Li3,, Wei-Shi Zhang3,, Hua Xu3,, Xiao-Ming Deng3 &, Yu-Qiu Zhang1",Yu-Qiu Zhang,yuqiuzhang@fudan.edu.cn,2012-05-30,"BackgroundSpinal glia, particularly microglia and astrocytes, are of the utmost importance in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. A recent study from our laboratory revealed that gabapentin, a recommended first-line treatment for multiple neuropathic conditions, could also efficiently antagonize thermal hyperalgesia evoked by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced monoarthritis (MA). In the present study, we investigated whether the spinal glia are involved in the anti-hyperalgesic effect of gabapentin and how this event occurs.ResultsUnilateral intra-articular injection of CFA produced a robust activation of microglia and astrocytes. These cells exhibited large cell bodies, thick processes and increases in the ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1, a microglial marker) or the glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocytic marker). These cells also displayed immunoreactive signals, and an upregulation of the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) α2/δ-1 subunit, CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression levels in the spinal cord. These changes were associated with the development of thermal hyperalgesia. Immunofluorescence staining showed that VGCC α2/δ-1 subunit, a proposed gabapentin target of action, was widely distributed in primary afferent fibers terminals and dorsal horn neurons. CX3CL1, a potential trigger to activate microglia, colocalized with VGCC α2/δ-1 subunits in the spinal dorsal horn. However, its receptor CX3CR1 was mainly expressed in the spinal microglia. Multiple intraperitoneal (i.p.) gabapentin injections (100 mg/kg, once daily for 4 days with the first injection 60 min before intra-articular CFA) suppressed the activation of spinal microglia, downregulated spinal VGCC α2/δ-1 subunits decreased CX3CL1 levels and blocked the development of thermal hyperalgesia in MA rats.ConclusionsHere we provide the first evidence that gabapentin diminishes CX3CL1 signaling and spinal microglia activation induced by joint inflammation. We also show that the VGCC α2/δ-1 subunits might be involved in these events.","α2/δ-1 subunit of Voltage-gated calcium channels, CX3CL1, CX3CR1, Gabapentin, Glial activation, Monoarthritis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-18,2012

There is currently no cure for this progressive and fatal disorder. The causative mutation of this hereditary disease is a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CAG) in the Huntingtin gene that results in an expanded polyglutamine tract. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the preferential striatal and cortical degeneration that occurs with HD, including non-cell-autonomous contribution from astrocytes. Although numerous cell culture and animal models exist, there is a great need for experimental systems that can more accurately replicate the human disease. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a remarkable new tool to study neurological disorders because this cell type can be derived from patients as a renewable, genetically tractable source for unlimited cells that are difficult to acquire, such as neurons and astrocytes. The development of experimental systems based on iPSC technology could aid in the identification of molecular lesions and therapeutic treatments.ResultsWe derived iPSCs from a father with adult onset HD and 50 CAG repeats (F-HD-iPSC) and his daughter with juvenile HD and 109 CAG repeats (D-HD-iPSC). These disease-specific iPSC lines were characterized by standard assays to assess the quality of iPSC lines and to demonstrate their pluripotency. HD-iPSCs were capable of producing phenotypically normal, functional neurons in vitro and were able to survive and differentiate into neurons in the adult mouse brain in vivo after transplantation. Surprisingly, when HD-iPSCs were directed to differentiate into an astrocytic lineage, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic, electron clear vacuoles in astrocytes from both F-HD-iPSCs and D-HD-iPSCs, which were significantly more pronounced in D-HD-astrocytes. Remarkably, the vacuolation in diseased astrocytes was observed under basal culture conditions without additional stressors and increased over time. Importantly, similar vacuolation phenotype has also been observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals with HD. Together, these data suggest that vacuolation may be a phenotype associated with HD.ConclusionsWe have generated a unique in vitro system to study HD pathogenesis using patient-specific iPSCs. The astrocytes derived from patient-specific iPSCs exhibit a vacuolation phenotype, a phenomenon previously documented in primary lymphocytes from HD patients. Our studies pave the way for future mechanistic investigations using human iPSCs to model HD and for high-throughput therapeutic screens.","Huntington’s disease, Induced pluripotent stem cells, Neural differentiation, Astrocytes, Disease modeling",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-17,2012

The present study was designed to investigate the role of spinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induced glial neuroinflammation in cancer induced pain using a modified rat model of bone cancer. The rat model of CIP consisted of unilateral intra-tibial injection with Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma. Nine days after Walker 256 inoculation, a robust activation of both astrocytes and microglia in bilateral spinal dorsal horn was observed together with significant bilateral mechanical allodynia. This neuroinflammation was characterized by enhanced immunostaining of both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocyte marker) and OX-42 (microglia marker), and an elevated level of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA. I.t. administration of fluorocitrate (an inhibitor of glial metabolism, 1 nmol) or minocycline (an inhibitor of microglia, 100 μg) has significant anti-allodynic effects on day 12 after Walker 256 inoculation. Naloxone (a nonstereoselective TLR4 signaling blocker, 60 μg, i.t.) also significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia and simultaneously blocked the increased inflammatory cytokine mRNA. The results suggested that spinal TLR4 might play an important role in the sustained glial activation that critically contributed to the robust and sustained spinal neuroinflammation in CIP. This result could potentially help clinicians and researchers to better understand the mechanism of complicated cancer pain.","Cancer induced pain, Glial activation, Toll-like receptor 4, Neuroinflammation, Rat",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-16,2012

Depletion of cellular GSH is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and thereby contributes to the associated oxidative stress and Ca2+ dysregulation. Whether depletion of cellular GSH, associated with neuronal senescence, directly influences Ca2+ permeation pathways is not known. Transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in several cell types including hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, activation of TRPM2 during oxidative stress has been linked to cell death. Importantly, GSH has been reported to inhibit TRPM2 channels, suggesting they may directly contribute to Ca2+ dysregulation associated with neuronal senescence. Herein, we explore the relation between cellular GSH and TRPM2 channel activity in long-term cultures of hippocampal neurons.ResultsIn whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observe that TRPM2 current density increases in cultured pyramidal neurons over time in vitro. The observed increase in current density was prevented by treatment with NAC, a precursor to GSH synthesis. Conversely, treatment of cultures maintained for 2 weeks in vitro with L-BSO, which depletes GSH by inhibiting its synthesis, augments TRPM2 currents. Additionally, we demonstrate that GSH inhibits TRPM2 currents through a thiol-independent mechanism, and produces a 3.5-fold shift in the dose-response curve generated by ADPR, the intracellular agonist for TRPM2.ConclusionThese results indicate that GSH plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of TRPM2 currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

Previous studies reveal that M4 muscarinic receptor knockout (M4R KO) mice displayed an increase in basal locomotor activity, an increase in sensitivity to the prepulse inhibition (PPI)-disrupting effect of psychotomimetics, and normal basal PPI. However, other behaviorally significant roles of M4R remain unclear.ResultsIn this study, to further investigate precise functional roles of M4R in the CNS, M4R KO mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests. M4R KO mice showed no significant impairments in nociception, neuromuscular strength, or motor coordination/learning. In open field, light/dark transition, and social interaction tests, consistent with previous studies, M4R KO mice displayed enhanced locomotor activity compared to their wild-type littermates. In the open field test, M4R KO mice exhibited novelty-induced locomotor hyperactivity. In the social interaction test, contacts between pairs of M4R KO mice lasted shorter than those of wild-type mice.

However, the roles of the RAR/RXR signaling pathway in learning and memory at the behavioral level have still not been well characterized in the adult brain. We here show essential roles for RAR/RXR in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In the current study, we generated transgenic mice in which the expression of dominant-negative RAR (dnRAR) could be induced in the mature brain using a tetracycline-dependent transcription factor and examined the effects of RAR/RXR loss.ResultsThe expression of dnRAR in the forebrain down-regulated the expression of RARβ, a target gene of RAR/RXR, indicating that dnRAR mice exhibit dysfunction of the RAR/RXR signaling pathway. Similar with previous findings, dnRAR mice displayed impaired LTP and AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. More importantly, these mutant mice displayed impaired hippocampus-dependent social recognition and spatial memory. However, these deficits of LTP and memory performance were rescued by stronger conditioning stimulation and spaced training, respectively.

Increasing evidence indicates that Wnt signaling regulates NMJ formation in Drosophila, C. elegans and zebrafish.ResultsIn the study we systematically studied the effect of all 19 different Wnts in mammals on acetylcholine receptor (AChR) cluster formation. We identified five Wnts (Wnt9a, Wnt9b, Wnt10b, Wnt11, and Wnt16) that are able to stimulate AChR clustering, of which Wnt9a and Wnt11 are expressed abundantly in developing muscles. Using Wnt9a and Wnt11 as example, we demonstrated that Wnt induction of AChR clusters was dose-dependent and non-additive to that of agrin, suggesting that Wnts may act via similar pathways to induce AChR clusters. We provide evidence that Wnt9a and Wnt11 bind directly to the extracellular domain of MuSK, to induce MuSK dimerization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase. In addition, Wnt-induced AChR clustering requires LRP4.ConclusionsThese results identify Wnts as new players in AChR cluster formation, which act in a manner that requires both MuSK and LRP4, revealing a novel function of LRP4.","Wnt, AChR clustering, muscle cells, synapse formation, neuromuscular junction",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-7,2012

AMPA receptor plasticity is strongly implicated in learning and memory, and studies have identified calcium permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) as mediators of synaptic strengthening. Trace fear learning engages the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but whether plastic events occur within the ACC in response to trace fear learning, and whether GluN2B subunits are required remains unknown. Here we show that the ACC is necessary for trace fear learning, and shows a rapid 20% upregulation of membrane AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits that is evident immediately after conditioning. Inhibition of NMDA receptor GluN2B subunits during training prevented the upregulation, and disrupted trace fear memory retrieval 48 h later. Furthermore, intra-ACC injections of the CP-AMPAR channel antagonist, 1-naphthylacetyl spermine (NASPM) immediately following trace fear conditioning blocked 24 h fear memory retrieval. Accordingly, whole cell patch clamp recordings from c-fos positive and c-fos negative neurons within the ACC in response to trace fear learning revealed an increased sensitivity to NASPM in recently activated neurons that was reversed by reconsolidation update extinction. Our results suggest that trace fear learning is mediated through rapid GluN2B dependent trafficking of CP-AMPARs, and present in vivo evidence that CP-AMPAR activity within the ACC immediately after conditioning is necessary for subsequent memory consolidation processes.","fear learning, memory consolidation, ACC, GluA1, NMDA, Ca2+ permeable AMPARs",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-6,2012

Transport of therapeutic peptides through this highly protective physiological barrier remains a challenge for peptide drug delivery into the central nervous system (CNS). Because the most common strategy to treat moderate to severe pain consists of the activation of opioid receptors in the brain, the development of active opioid peptide analogues as potential analgesics requires compounds with a high resistance to enzymatic degradation and an ability to cross the BBB.ResultsHerein we report that tetrapeptide analogues of the type H-Dmt1-Xxx2-Yyy3-Gly4-NH2 are transported into the brain after intravenous and subcutaneous administration and are able to activate the μ- and δ opioid receptors more efficiently and over longer periods of time than morphine. Using the hot water tail flick test as the animal model for antinociception, a comparison in potency is presented between a side chain conformationally constrained analogue containing the benzazepine ring (BVD03, Yyy3: Aba), and a ""ring opened"" analogue (BVD02, Yyy3: Phe). The results show that in addition to the increased lipophilicity through amide bond N-methylation, the conformational constraint introduced at the level of the Phe3 side chain causes a prolonged antinociception. Further replacement of NMe-D-Ala2 by D-Arg2 in the tetrapeptide sequence led to an improved potency as demonstrated by a higher and maintained antinociception for AN81 (Xxx2: D-Arg) vs. BVD03 (Xxx2: NMe-D-Ala). A daily injection of the studied opioid ligands over a time period of 5 days did however result in a substantial decrease in antinociception on the fifth day of the experiment. The compact opioid agonist - NK1 antagonist hybrid SBCHM01 could not circumvent opioid induced tolerance.ConclusionsWe demonstrated that the introduction of a conformational constraint has an important impact on opioid receptor activation and subsequent antinociception in vivo. Further amino acid substitution allowed to identify AN81 as an opioid ligand able to access the CNS and induce antinociception at very low doses (0.1 mg/kg) over a time period up to 7 hours. However, tolerance became apparent after repetitive i.v. administration of the investigated tetrapeptides.

Tachykinin 2 (Tac2) encodes a neurotransmitter, neurokinin B (NKB).ResultsBy crossing Tac2-Cre mice with ROSA26-tdTomato reporter mice, we directly visualized Tac2 lineage neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and many parts of the brain including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, habenula, hypothalamus, and cerebellum.

However, the mechanisms by which the expression of Wnt proteins is regulated in neurons are unclear. Using cortical primary cultures, we show here that activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) induces rapid Wnt5a protein synthesis and secretion. This NMDAR-regulated Wnt5a synthesis does not require transcription and is a result of activity-dependent translation. We also show that NMDAR-regulated Wnt5a translation depends on MAPK signaling but not mTOR signaling. Our findings suggest that the synaptic activity of CNS neurons activates NMDARs, which in turn stimulate translation from stored Wnt5a mRNA via the MAPK signaling pathway.","activity-regulated protein synthesis, Wnt protein, mTOR signaling, MAPK signaling, NMDA receptors",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-1,2012

Highly expressed within the CNS, we have previously demonstrated the functional expression of these channels in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Although implicated in oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death, and potentially in neurodegenerative disease, the physiological role of TRPM2 in the central nervous system is unknown. Interestingly, we have shown that the activation of these channels may be sensitized by co-incident NMDA receptor activation, suggesting a potential contribution of TRPM2 to synaptic transmission. Using hippocampal cultures and slices from TRPM2 null mice we demonstrate that the loss of these channels selectively impairs NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) while sparing long-term potentiation. Impaired LTD resulted from an inhibition of GSK-3β, through increased phosphorylation, and a reduction in the expression of PSD95 and AMPARs. Notably, LTD could be rescued in TRPM2 null mice by recruitment of GSK-3β signaling following dopamine D2 receptor stimulation.

Human nigral neurons characteristically contain the pigment neuromelanin (NM), which is believed to alter the cellular redox-status. The impact of neuronal pigmentation, neurotransmitter status and brainstem location on the susceptibility to mtDNA damage remains unclear. We quantified mtDNA deletions (ΔmtDNA) in single pigmented and non-pigmented catecholaminergic, as well as non-catecholaminergic neurons of the human SNc, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the locus coeruleus (LC), using laser capture microdissection and single-cell real-time PCR.ResultsIn healthy aged individuals, ΔmtDNA levels were highest in pigmented catecholaminergic neurons (25.2 ± 14.9%), followed by non-pigmented catecholamergic (18.0 ± 11.2%) and non-catecholaminergic neurons (12.3 ± 12.3%; p < 0.001). Within the catecholaminergic population, ΔmtDNA levels were highest in dopaminergic neurons of the SNc (33.9 ± 21.6%) followed by dopaminergic neurons of the VTA (21.9 ± 12.3%) and noradrenergic neurons of the LC (11.1 ± 11.4%; p < 0.001). In PD patients, there was a trend to an elevated mutation load in surviving non-pigmented nigral neurons (27.13 ± 16.73) compared to age-matched controls (19.15 ± 11.06; p = 0.052), but levels where similar in pigmented nigral neurons of PD patients (41.62 ± 19.61) and controls (41.80 ± 22.62).ConclusionsCatecholaminergic brainstem neurons are differentially susceptible to mtDNA damage. Pigmented dopaminergic neurons of the SNc show the highest ΔmtDNA levels, possibly explaining the exceptional vulnerability of the nigro-striatal system in PD and aging. Although loss of pigmented noradrenergic LC neurons also is an early feature of PD pathology, mtDNA levels are not elevated in this nucleus in healthy controls.

Recently, we reported that GABA present in astrocyte is the major source of tonic inhibition in cerebellum and that GABA is released through Bestrophin-1 channel by direct permeation. In this study, we screened for the presence of astrocytic GABA in various brain regions such as hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and cerebellum using immunohistochemistry. We found that astrocytic GABA was present in the regions that were reported to show tonic inhibition. Because the existence of tonic inhibition in hippocampal CA1 is somewhat controversial, we compared the amount of astrocytic GABA and tonic inhibition between the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer and the cerebellar granule cell layer. Unlike cerebellar glial cells, hippocampal astrocytes did not contain GABA. The tonic inhibition was also much lower in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1 compared to the granule cells of cerebellum. Nevertheless, most of the hippocampal astrocytes expressed Bestrophin-1 channel. These data indicate that the absence of astrocytic GABA results in a low level of tonic inhibition in hippocampal CA1 region.","Pyramidal Neuron, GABAA Receptor, Cerebellar Granule Cell, Tonic Inhibition, Hippocampal Pyramidal Cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-42,2011

As both supporting and refuting evidence for the hypothesis of subunit specialization in opposing directions of plasticity has accumulated since it was first proposed a few years ago, we hypothesize that differences in experimental conditions may have in part contributed to some of the inconsistent results from these studies. Here we investigate the controversial hypothesis that long-term depression (LTD) is preferentially induced by GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in area CA1 of hippocampal slices.ResultsWe find that brain slices from 2-3 week old rats prepared in the sagittal orientation have GluN2B-independent LTD whereas slices prepared in the coronal orientation have GluN2B-dependent LTD. There was no difference between the orientations in the fraction of the NMDAR EPSC sensitive to a GluN2B-selective antagonist, leading us to believe that the intracellular signaling properties of the NMDARs were different in the two preparations. Coronal slices had greater association of LTD-related intracellular signaling protein RasGRF1 with GluN2B relative to sagittal slices. Antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the sagittal slices returned LTD to a GluN2B-dependent form and increased the association of GluN2B with RasGRF1.ConclusionsThese results suggest a novel form of NMDAR modulation by mAChRs and clarify some disagreement in the literature.","Hippocampus, Long-term depression, N-methyl D-Aspartate receptor, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-41,2011

Fluorescent in situ hybridization also showed that miR-134 is enriched in the growth cones of Xenopus spinal neurons in culture. Importantly, overexpression of miR-134 mimics or antisense inhibitors blocked protein synthesis (PS)-dependent attractive responses of Xenopus growth cones to a gradient of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, miR-134 mimics or inhibitors had no effect on PS-independent bidirectional responses of Xenopus growth cones to bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7).

After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region.

In order to further elucidate the role of NC cells in olfactory development, we examined the olfactory system in the transgenic mice Wnt1-Cre/Floxed-EGFP and P0-Cre/Floxed-EGFP, in which migrating NC cells and its descendents permanently express GFP, and conducted transposon-mediated cell lineage tracing studies in chick embryos.ResultsExamination of these transgenic mice revealed GFP-positive cells in the OE, demonstrating that NC-derived cells give rise to OE cells with morphologic and antigenic properties identical to placode-derived cells.

PAR1 activation enhances excitatory synaptic transmission secondary to the release of glutamate from astrocytes following activation of astrocytically-expressed PAR1. In addition, PAR1 activation exacerbates neuronal damage in multiple in vivo models of brain injury in a manner that is dependent on NMDA receptors. In the hippocampal formation, PAR1 mRNA appears to be expressed by a subset of neurons, including granule cells in the dentate gyrus. In this study we investigate the role of PAR activation in controlling neuronal excitability of dentate granule cells. We confirm that PAR1 protein is expressed in neurons of the dentate cell body layer as well as in astrocytes throughout the dentate. Activation of PAR1 receptors by the selective peptide agonist TFLLR increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a subset of acutely dissociated dentate neurons as well as non-neuronal cells. Bath application of TFLLR in acute hippocampal slices depolarized the dentate gyrus, including the hilar region in wild type but not in the PAR1-/- mice. PAR1 activation increased the frequency of action potential generation in a subset of dentate granule neurons; cells in which PAR1 activation triggered action potentials showed a significant depolarization. The activation of PAR1 by thrombin increased the amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated component of EPSPs.

How this occurs, however, is still only partially understood. To investigate the trafficking of AMPA receptors in real-time we previously tagged the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors with ecliptic pHluorin and studied the effects of NMDA receptor activation. In the present study we have compared the effect of NMDA receptor and group I mGluR activation, using GluA2 tagged with super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP-GluA2) expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Surprisingly, agonists of the two receptors, which are both able to induce chemical forms of LTD, had clearly distinct effects on AMPA receptor trafficking. In agreement with our previous work we found that transient NMDA receptor activation results in an initial decrease in surface GluA2 from extrasynaptic sites followed by a delayed reduction in GluA2 from puncta (putative synapses). In contrast, transient activation of group I mGluRs, using DHPG, led to a pronounced but more delayed decrease in GluA2 from the dendritic shafts. Surprisingly, there was no average change in the fluorescence of the puncta. Examination of fluorescence at individual puncta, however, indicated that alterations did take place, with some puncta showing an increase and others a decrease in fluorescence. The effects of DHPG were, like DHPG-induced LTD, prevented by treatment with a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor. The electrophysiological correlate of the effects of DHPG in the SEP-GluA2 infected cultures was a reduction in mEPSC frequency with no change in amplitude.

Next, we tested adult mice in an associative olfactory task and found that fetal alcohol exposure impaired discrimination between similar odors but left odor memory intact. Finally, we investigated olfactory bulb neurogenesis as a potential mechanism by performing an in vitro neurosphere assay, in vivo labeling of new cells using BrdU, and in vivo labeling of new cells using a transgenic reporter system.

Much previous work has focused on the deleterious effects of METH on mature neurons, but little is known about the effects of METH on neural progenitor cells (NPCs). It is now well established that new neurons are continuously generated from NPCs in the adult hippocampus, and accumulating evidence suggests important roles for these neurons in hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions. In a rat hippocampal NPC culture system, we find that METH results in a dose-dependent reduction of NPC proliferation, and higher concentrations of METH impair NPC survival. NPC differentiation, however, is not affected by METH, suggesting cell-stage specificity of the effects of METH. We demonstrate that the effects of METH on NPCs are, in part, mediated through oxidative and nitrosative stress. Further, we identify seventeen NPC proteins that are post-translationally modified via 3-nitrotyrosination in response to METH, using mass spectrometric approaches. One such protein was pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), an important mediator of cellular energetics and proliferation. We identify sites of PKM2 that undergo nitrotyrosination, and demonstrate that nitration of the protein impairs its activity. Thus, METH abuse may result in impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and effects on NPCs may be mediated by protein nitration.

Long-term changes of spine dynamics and microglia after transient peripheral immune response triggered by LPS in vivo,"Satoru Kondo1,, Shinichi Kohsaka2 &, Shigeo Okabe1",Satoru Kondo,kondo@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp,2011-06-17,"BackgroundAn episode of peripheral immune response may create long-lasting alterations in the neural network. Recent studies indicate a glial involvement in synaptic remodeling. Therefore it is postulated that both synaptic and glial changes could occur under the peripheral inflammation.ResultsWe tested this possibility by in vivo two-photon microscopy of dendritic spines after induction of a peripheral immune response by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mice.We observed that the spines were less stable in LPS-treated mice. The accumulation of spine changes gradually progressed and remained low over a week after LPS treatment but became significantly larger at four weeks. Over eight weeks after LPS treatment, the fraction of eliminated spines amounted to 20% of the initial population and this persistent destabilization resulted in a reduction of the total spine density.We next evaluated glial activation by LPS administration. Activation of microglia was confirmed by a persistent increase of Iba1 immunoreactivity. Morphological changes in microglia were observed two days after LPS administration and were partially recovered within one week but sustained over a long time period.ConclusionsThese results indicate long-lasting aggravating effects of a single transient peripheral immune response on both spines and microglia. The parallel persistent alterations of both spine turnover and the state of microglia in vivo suggest the presence of a pathological mechanism that sustains the enhanced remodeling of neural networks weeks after peripheral immune responses. This pathological mechanism may also underlie long-lasting cognitive dysfunctions after septic encephalopathy in human patients.","Peripheral inflammation, Spine, Microglia, in vivo imaging, Sepsis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-27,2011

Its pathogenesis may involve multiple genetic and nongenetic factors, but its etiology remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the genome of a patient with MSA would demonstrate copy number variations (CNVs) in the genes or genomic regions of interest. To identify genomic alterations increasing the risk for MSA, we examined a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for the MSA phenotype and 32 patients with MSA.ResultsBy whole-genome CNV analysis using a combination of CNV beadchip and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based CNV microarrays followed by region-targeting, high-density, custom-made oligonucleotide tiling microarray analysis, we identified disease-specific copy number loss of the (Src homology 2 domain containing)-transforming protein 2 (SHC2) gene in the distal 350-kb subtelomeric region of 19p13.3 in the affected MZ twin and 10 of the 31 patients with MSA but not in 2 independent control populations (p = 1.04 × 10-8, odds ratio = 89.8, Pearson's chi-square test).ConclusionsCopy number loss of SHC2 strongly indicates a causal link to MSA.

Deposition of Aβ plaques is also a common pathological feature of HIV infection. However, it is not clear whether this accumulation is due to AD-like processes, HIV-associated immunosuppression, Tat protein-induced Aβ elevations, and/or the effects of single highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we evaluated the effects of several ART medications (Zidovudine, Lamivudine, Indinavir, and Abacavir) alone and in combination on: 1) Aβ1-40, 42 generation in murine N2a cells transfected with the human ""Swedish"" mutant form of APP; 2) microglial phagocytosis of FITC-Aβ1-42 peptides in cultured murine N9 microglia. We report for the first time that these antiretroviral compounds (10 μM) generally increase Aβ generation (~50-200%) in SweAPP N2a cells and markedly inhibit microglial phagocytosis of FITC-Aβ1-42 peptides in murine microglia. The most significant amyloidogenic effects were observed with combined ART (p < 0.05); suggesting certain ART medications may have additive amyloidogenic effects when combined. As these antiretroviral compounds are capable of penetrating the blood brain barrier and reaching the concentrations employed in the in vitro studies, these findings raise the possibility that ART may play a casual role in the elevated Aβ found in the brains of those infected with HIV.

mRNA binding protein staufen 1-dependent regulation of pyramidal cell spine morphology via NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity,"Geneviève Lebeau1,, Luc DesGroseillers2,, Wayne Sossin3 &, Jean-Claude Lacaille1",Jean-Claude Lacaille,jean-claude.lacaille@umontreal.ca,2011-06-02,"Staufens (Stau) are RNA-binding proteins involved in mRNA transport, localization, decay and translational control. The Staufen 1 (Stau1) isoform was recently identified as necessary for the protein synthesis-dependent late phase long-term potentiation (late-LTP) and for the maintenance of mature dendritic spines and synaptic activity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, strongly suggesting a role of mRNA regulation by Stau1 in these processes. However, the causal relationship between these impairments in synaptic function (spine shape and basal synaptic activity) and plasticity (late-LTP) remains unclear. Here, we determine that the effects of Stau1 knockdown on spine shape and size are mimicked by blocking NMDA receptors (or elevating extracellular Mg2+) and that Stau1 knockdown in the presence of NMDA receptor blockade (or high Mg2+) has no further effect on spine shape and size. Moreover, the effect of Stau1 knockdown on late-LTP cannot be explained by these effects, since when tested in normal medium, slice cultures that had been treated with high Mg2+ (to impair NMDA receptor function) in combination with a control siRNA still exhibited late-LTP, while siRNA to Stau1 was still effective in blocking late-LTP. Our results indicate that Stau1 involvement in spine morphogenesis is dependent on ongoing NMDA receptor-mediated plasticity, but its effects on late-LTP are independent of these changes. These findings clarify the role of Stau1-dependent mRNA regulation in physiological and morphological changes underlying long-term synaptic plasticity in pyramidal cells.","Schaffer collateral synapses, RNA transport, late LTP, spontaneous activity-driven potentiation, spine morphogenesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-22,2011
Transcriptional dysregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in mental illness,"Paul R Albert1,, Brice Le François1 &, Anne M Millar1",Paul R Albert,palbert@uottawa.ca,2011-05-27,"The serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor is among the most abundant and widely distributed 5-HT receptors in the brain, but is also expressed on serotonin neurons as an autoreceptor where it plays a critical role in regulating the activity of the entire serotonin system. Over-expression of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor has been implicated in reducing serotonergic neurotransmission, and is associated with major depression and suicide. Extensive characterization of the transcriptional regulation of the 5-HT1A gene (HTR1A) using cell culture systems has revealed a GC-rich ""housekeeping"" promoter that non-selectively drives its expression; this is flanked by a series of upstream repressor elements for REST, Freud-1/CC2D1A and Freud-2/CC2D1B factors that not only restrict its expression to neurons, but may also regulate the level of expression of 5-HT1A receptors in various subsets of neurons, including serotonergic neurons.

Pet1, an obligatory enhancer for serotonergic differentiation, has been identified as a potent activator of 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression. Taken together, these results highlight an integrated regulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors that differs in several aspects from regulation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, and could be selectively targeted to enhance serotonergic neurotransmission.","Raphe Nucleus, Minimal Promoter, Acute Tryptophan Depletion, Antidepressant Response, Serotonergic Neurotransmission",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-21,2011

Although GPCRs were thought to function as monomers, many studies support the hypothesis that G protein coupling involves the formation of GPCR homo- and/or hetero-complexes. These complex systems have been suggested to exhibit specific signaling cascades, pharmacological, internalization, and recycling properties.

In dual recordings from the soma vs. axon, the signals recorded in vivo induce somatic spikes with higher capacity, which is associated with lower somatic thresholds and shorter refractory periods mediated by voltage-gated sodium channels.

The amygdala, composed of heterogeneous subnuclei, participates in multiple functional circuits regulating emotional responses to stress. We hypothesized that sex differences in molecular structure may contribute to differential mood regulation and disease vulnerability.FindingsUsing gene arrays followed by quantitative PCR validation, we compared the transcriptome profiles between sexes in human and mouse amygdala. We now report sexually dimorphic features of transcriptomes in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and these features are highly conserved across species. A functional analysis of differential gene expression showed that mitochondrial-related gene groups were identified as the top biological pathways associated with sexual dimorphism in both species.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the basolateral amygdala is a sexually dimorphic structure, featuring a regulatory cascade of mitochondrial function and circadian rhythm, potentially linked through sirtuins and hormone nuclear receptors. Hence, baseline differences in amygdalar circadian regulation of cellular metabolism may contribute to sex-related differences in mood regulation and vulnerability to major depression.","Sexual Dimorphism, Mood Disorder, Circadian Clock, Amygdala Nucleus, Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-18,2011
Genome-wide screen for modifiers of Parkinson's disease genes in Drosophila,"Caroline Fernandes1,2 &, Yong Rao2",Yong Rao,yong.rao@mcgill.ca,2011-04-19,"BackgroundMutations in parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) lead to autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). parkin and Pink1 encode a ubiquitin-protein ligase and a mitochondrially localized serine/threonine kinase, respectively. Recent studies have implicated Parkin and Pink1 in a common and evolutionarily conserved pathway for protecting mitochondrial integrity.ResultsTo systematically identify novel components of the PD pathways, we generated a genetic background that allowed us to perform a genome-wide F1 screen for modifiers of Drosophila parkin (park) and Pink1 mutant phenotype. From screening ~80% of the fly genome, we identified a number of cytological regions that interact with park and/or Pink1. Among them, four cytological regions were selected for identifying corresponding PD-interacting genes. By analyzing smaller deficiency chromosomes, available transgenic RNAi lines, and P-element insertions, we identified five PD-interacting genes. Among them, opa1 and drp1 have been previously implicated in the PD pathways, whereas debra (dbr), Pi3K21B and β4GalNAcTA are novel PD-interacting genes.ConclusionsWe took an unbiased genetic approach to systematically isolate modifiers of PD genes in Drosophila.

Some gap junction proteins, namely connexins and pannexins in vertebrates, and innexins in invertebrates, may also function as hemichannels. A conserved NCA/Dmα1U/NALCN family cation leak channel regulates the excitability and activity of vertebrate and invertebrate neurons. In the present study, we describe a genetic and functional interaction between the innexin UNC-7 and the cation leak channel NCA in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. While the loss of the neuronal NCA channel function leads to a reduced evoked postsynaptic current at neuromuscular junctions, a simultaneous loss of the UNC-7 function restores the evoked response. The expression of UNC-7 in neurons reverts the effect of the unc-7 mutation; moreover, the expression of UNC-7 mutant proteins that are predicted to be unable to form gap junctions also reverts this effect, suggesting that UNC-7 innexin regulates neuronal activity, in part, through gap junction-independent functions. We propose that, in addition to gap junction-mediated functions, UNC-7 innexin may also form hemichannels to regulate C. elegans' neuronal activity cooperatively with the NCA family leak channels.","Nerve Cord, Neuro2A Cell, Aldicarb, Body Wall Muscle, EPSC Amplitude",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-16,2011

However, very few molecules have been identified that are involved in determining where and how many synapses form. The Plexin cell-surface molecules are a conserved family of axon guidance receptors that mediate axon fasciculation and repulsion during neural development, and later in development PlexinA receptors are involved in eliminating axonal branches and synapse numbers. Here we investigate the roles of PlexinA and PlexinB receptors in axonal branch and varicosity formation in Drosophila. We knocked down PlexinA or PlexinB expression using RNAi in identified mechanosensory neurons and analyzed axonal branching patterns and varicosity formations. Reducing PlexinA expression increased the axonal arbor complexity by increasing the number of branches and varicosities along the axon. In contrast, knocking down PlexinB expression decreased morphological complexity by decreasing the number of branches and the overall size of the axonal arbor, but did not reduce the number of varicosities. Our results demonstrate opposing roles for PlexinA and PlexinB in local wiring within a target region, where PlexinA functions to suppress excessive axonal branches and synapses and PlexinB facilitates axonal growth.","Axon Guidance, Thoracic Ganglion, Variable Branch, Axonal Branch, Axonal Arbor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-15,2011

The Musashi1 (Msi1) protein, which belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of RNA-binding proteins, is a marker for neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) in the embryonic and post-natal central nervous system (CNS). Msi1 regulates the translation of its downstream targets, including m-Numb and p21 mRNAs. In vitro experiments using knockout mice have shown that Msi1 and its isoform Musashi2 (Msi2) keep NS/PCs in an undifferentiated and proliferative state. Msi1 is expressed not only in NS/PCs, but also in other somatic stem cells and in tumours. Based on previous findings, Msi1 is likely to be a key regulator for maintaining the characteristics of self-renewing stem cells. However, the mechanisms regulating Msi1 expression are not yet clear.ResultsTo identify the DNA region affecting Msi1 transcription, we inserted the fusion gene ffLuc, comprised of the fluorescent Venus protein and firefly Luciferase, at the translation initiation site of the mouse Msi1 gene locus contained in a 184-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Fluorescence and Luciferase activity, reflecting the Msi1 transcriptional activity, were observed in a stable BAC-carrying embryonic stem cell line when it was induced toward neural lineage differentiation by retinoic acid treatment. When neuronal differentiation was induced in embryoid body (EB)-derived neurosphere cells, reporter signals were detected in Msi1-positive NSCs and GFAP-positive astrocytes, but not in MAP2-positive neurons. By introducing deletions into the BAC reporter gene and conducting further reporter experiments using a minimized enhancer region, we identified a region, ""D5E2,"" that is responsible for Msi1 transcription in NS/PCs.ConclusionsA regulatory element for Msi1 transcription in NS/PCs is located in the sixth intron of the Msi1 gene. The 595-bp D5E2 intronic enhancer can transactivate Msi1 gene expression with cell-type specificity markedly similar to the endogenous Msi1 expression patterns.","Retinoic Acid, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Clone, Embryoid Body, Somatic Stem Cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-14,2011

To more directly assess the roles of impaired insulin and IGF signaling during brain development, we administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of si-RNA targeting the insulin receptor, (InR), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), or IGF-2R into postnatal day 2 (P2) Long Evans rat pups and examined the sustained effects on cerebellar function, structure, and neurotransmitter-related gene expression (P20).ResultsRotarod tests on P20 demonstrated significant impairments in motor function, and histological studies revealed pronounced cerebellar hypotrophy, hypoplasia, and hypofoliation in si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R treated rats. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that si-InR, and to a lesser extent si-IGF-2R, broadly inhibited expression of insulin and IGF-2 polypeptides, and insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors in the brain. ELISA studies showed that si-InR increased cerebellar levels of tau, phospho-tau and β-actin, and inhibited GAPDH. In addition, si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R inhibited expression of choline acetyltransferase, which mediates motor function. Although the ICV si-RNA treatments generally spared the neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor expression, si-InR and si-IGF-1R inhibited NT3, while si-IGF-1R suppressed BDNF.Conclusionsearly postnatal inhibition of brain InR expression, and to lesser extents, IGF-R, causes structural and functional abnormalities that resemble effects of FASD. The findings suggest that major abnormalities in brains with FASD are mediated by impairments in insulin/IGF signaling.

Behavioral destabilization induced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine,"Katsunori Kobayashi1,2,, Yumiko Ikeda1 &, Hidenori Suzuki1,2",Katsunori Kobayashi,kkatsu-tky@umin.ac.jp,2011-03-16,"BackgroundSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. However, neuronal bases for both beneficial and adverse effects of SSRIs remain poorly understood. We have recently shown that the SSRI fluoxetine can reverse the state of maturation of hippocampal granule cells in adult mice. The granule cell ""dematuration"" is induced in a large population of granule cells, and greatly changes functional and physiological properties of these cells. Here we show that this unique form of neuronal plasticity is correlated with a distinct change in behavior of mice.ResultsWe chronically treated adult male mice with fluoxetine, and examined its effect on several forms of behavior of mice. During fluoxetine treatments, mice showed a marked increase in day-to-day fluctuations of home cage activity levels that was characterized by occasional switching between hypoactivity and hyperactivity within a few days. This destabilized cage activity was accompanied by increased anxiety-related behaviors and could be observed up to 4 weeks after withdrawal from fluoxetine. As reported previously, the granule cell dematuration by fluoxetine includes a reduction of synaptic facilitation at the granule cell output, mossy fiber, synapse to the juvenile level. Mossy fiber synaptic facilitation examined electrophysiologically in acute hippocampal slices also remained suppressed after fluoxetine withdrawal and significantly correlated with the fluctuation of cage activity levels in individual mice. Furthermore, in mice lacking the 5-HT4 receptor, in which the granule cell dematuration has been shown to be attenuated, fluoxetine had no significant effect on the fluctuation of cage activity levels.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that the SSRI fluoxetine can induce marked day-to-day changes in activity levels of mice in the familiar environment, and that the dematuration of the hippocampal granule cells is closely associated with the expression of this destabilized behavior. Based on these results, we propose that the granule cell dematuration can be a potential cellular basis underlying switching-like changes in the behavioral state associated with SSRI treatments.","Fluoxetine, Granule Cell, Mossy Fiber, Tail Suspension Test, Fluoxetine Treatment",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-12,2011

In contrast, some studies claimed that there was very little alteration of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) by the antidepressants. Since almost all of those studies treated animals with drugs for 2 to 4 weeks as chronic treatment models of antidepressants, it is possible that antidepressant treatments for longer periods would affect adult neurogenesis in the SVZ.ResultsIn the present study, we examined the effects of long-term (up to 9 weeks) administration of fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on cell proliferation and survival in the DG and the SVZ of adult mice. As reported previously, in the DG of mice treated with FLX for 3, 6, or 9 weeks that were also injected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in the last 3 days before perfusion, the numbers of Ki67- and BrdU-positive cells, which are cell proliferation markers, were significantly upregulated even at 3 weeks after the onset of the FLX treatments, and these increases were sustained in mice treated with FLX for 9 weeks. On the other hand, in the SVZ, we found a small, insignificant decrease in the numbers of Ki67- and BrdU-positive cells at 3 weeks, followed by highly significant decreases in the numbers of Ki67- and BrdU-positive cells at both 6 and 9 weeks. Furthermore, among olfactory newly generated cells that survived for 3 weeks after BrdU injection, the number of new cells was decreased at 9 weeks of FLX treatment.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that long-term (more than 6 weeks) treatment with FLX has the opposite effect on neurogenesis in the SVZ than it does in the DG. The results also suggest that the decrease in neurogenesis in the SVZ might be involved in some aspects of the drugs' therapeutic effects on depression. In addition, our findings raise the possibility that some of the side effects of antidepressants might be mediated by decreased adult neurogenesis in the SVZ.","Granule Cell, Olfactory Bulb, Dentate Gyrus, Neural Stem Cell, Adult Neurogenesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-10,2011

Molecular studies on the regulation of memory stability after retrieval have focused almost exclusively on fear memory, especially on the restabilization process of the reactivated fear memory. We previously showed that, similarly with fear memories, reactivated spatial memory undergoes reconsolidation in the Morris water maze. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which reactivated spatial memory is destabilized and restabilized remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism that regulates the stability of the reactivated spatial memory.ResultsWe first showed that pharmacological inactivation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) in the hippocampus or genetic inhibition of cAMP-responsible element binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription disrupted reactivated spatial memory. Finally, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and L-type voltage gated calcium channels (LVGCCs) in the hippocampus blocked the disruption of the reactivated spatial memory by the inhibition of protein synthesis.ConclusionsOur findings indicated that the reactivated spatial memory is destabilized through the activation of CB1 and LVGCCs and then restabilized through the activation of NMDAR- and CREB-mediated transcription. We also suggest that the reactivated spatial memory undergoes destabilization and restabilization in the hippocampus, through similar molecular processes as those for reactivated contextual fear memories, which require CB1 and LVGCCs for destabilization and NMDAR and CREB for restabilization.","Spatial Memory, Spatial Learning, Morris Water Maze, Probe Trial, Escape Latency",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-9,2011
Properties of Contextual Memory Formed in the Absence of αCaMKII Autophosphorylation,"Elaine E Irvine1,2,, Arthur Danhiez3,, Kasia Radwanska4,5,, Charlotte Nassim1,, Walter Lucchesi4,, Emile Godaux3,, Laurence Ris3 &, K Peter Giese1,4",K Peter Giese,karl.giese@kcl.ac.uk,2011-01-28,"The alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (αCaMKII) is a major synaptic kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation after NMDA receptor activation, switching the kinase into a calcium-independent activity state. This αCaMKII autophosphorylation is essential for NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), induced by a single tetanus, in hippocampal area CA1 and in neocortex. Furthermore, the αCaMKII autophosphorylation is essential for contextual long-term memory (LTM) formation after a single training trial but not after a massed training session. Here, we show that in the absence of αCaMKII autophosphorylation contextual fear conditioning is hippocampus dependent and that multi-tetanus-dependent late-LTP cannot be induced in hippocampal area CA1. Furthermore, we show that in the absence of αCaMKII autophosphorylation contextual LTM persists for 30 days, the latest time point tested. Additionally, contextual, but not cued, LTM formation in the absence of αCaMKII autophosphorylation appears to be impaired in 18 month-old mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that αCaMKII autophosphorylation-independent plasticity in the hippocampus is sufficient for contextual LTM formation and that αCaMKII autophosphorylation may be important for delaying age-related impairments in hippocampal memory formation. Furthermore, they propose that NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in hippocampal area CA1 is essential for contextual LTM formation after a single trial but not after massed training. Finally, our results challenge the proposal that NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in neocortex is required for remote contextual LTM.","Fear Memory, Contextual Fear Conditioning, Contextual Fear Memory, Adult Dentate Gyrus, Field Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-8,2011

A multimodal protein, Galectin-1, is expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and implicated in the proliferation of the NPCs in the DG. However, little is known about its detailed expression profile in the NPCs and functions in adult neurogenesis in the DG.ResultsOur immunohistochemical and morphological analysis showed that Galectin-1 was expressed in the type 1 and 2a cells, which are putative NSCs, in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the adult mouse DG. To study Galectin-1's function in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we made galectin-1 knock-out mice on the C57BL6 background and characterized the effects on neurogenesis. In the SGZ of the galectin-1 knock-out mice, increased numbers of type 1 cells, DCX-positive immature progenitors, and NeuN-positive newborn neurons were observed. Using triple-labeling immunohistochemistry and morphological analyses, we found that the proliferation of the type-1 cells was increased in the SGZ of the galectin-1 knock-out mice, and we propose that this proliferation is the mechanism for the net increase in the adult neurogenesis in these knock-out mice DG.ConclusionsGalectin-1 is expressed in the neural stem cells and down-regulates neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.","Dentate Gyrus, Neural Progenitor Cell, Adult Neurogenesis, Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis, Adult Mammalian Brain",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-7,2011

Despite human brain imaging studies, which have implicated the prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), little is known about the ACC in anxiety disorders. Here we show that the ACC does modulate anxiety-like behavior in adult mice, and have identified a protein that is critical for this modulation. Absence of neurabin, a cytoskeletal protein, resulted in reduced anxiety-like behavior and increased depression-like behavior. Selective inhibition of neurabin in the ACC reproduced the anxiety but not the depression phenotype. Furthermore, loss of neurabin increased the presynaptic release of glutamate and cingulate neuronal excitability. These findings reveal novel roles of the ACC in anxiety disorders, and provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety disorders.","Anxiety Disorder, Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Affective Disorder, Behavioral Despair, Anterior Cingulate Cortex Neuron",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-6,2011

In animals, this is a crucial feature for survival, by making it possible for them to adapt their behavioral patterns to the ever-changing environment. For this learning and memory process, nerve cells in the brain undergo enormous molecular and cellular changes, not only in the input-output-related local subcellular compartments but also in the central nucleus. Interestingly, the DNA methylation pattern, which is normally stable in a terminally differentiated cell and defines the cell type identity, is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism of behavioral plasticity. The elucidation of how this covalent modification of DNA, which is known to be the most stable epigenetic mark, contributes to the complex orchestration of animal behavior is a fascinating new research area.

Induction and requirement of gene expression in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex for the consolidation of inhibitory avoidance memory,"Yue Zhang1,2,, Hotaka Fukushima1,2 &, Satoshi Kida1,2",Satoshi Kida,kida@nodai.ac.jp,2011-01-19,"BackgroundMemory consolidation is a process to stabilize short-term memory, generating long-term memory. A critical biochemical feature of memory consolidation is a requirement for gene expression. Previous studies have shown that fear memories are consolidated through the activation of gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus, indicating essential roles of these brain regions in memory formation. However, it is still poorly understood whether gene expression in brain regions other than the amygdala/hippocampus is required for the consolidation of fear memory; however, several brain regions are known to play modulatory roles in fear memory formation.ResultsTo further understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of fear memory, we first identified brain regions where gene expression is activated after learning inhibitory avoidance (IA) by analyzing the expression of the immediately early genes c-fos and Arc as markers. Similarly with previous findings, the induction of c-fos and Arc expression was observed in the amygdala and hippocampus. Interestingly, we also observed the induction of c-fos and Arc expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC: prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) regions) and Arc expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We next examined the roles of these brain regions in the consolidation of IA memory. Consistent with previous findings, inhibiting protein synthesis in the hippocampus blocked the consolidation of IA memory. More importantly, inhibition in the mPFC or ACC also blocked the formation of IA memory.ConclusionOur observations indicated that the formation of IA memory requires gene expression in the ACC and mPFC as well as in the amygdala and hippocampus, suggesting essential roles of the ACC and mPFC in IA memory formation.","Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Fear Memory, Inhibitory Avoidance, Dark Compartment, Contextual Fear Memory",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-4,2011

Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that overproduction/aggregation of Aβ in the brain is a primary cause of AD and inhibition of Aβ generation has become a hot topic in AD research. Aβ is generated from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages first by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase complex. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ domain to release soluble APPα and preclude Aβ generation. Cleavage of APP by caspases may also contribute to AD pathologies. Therefore, understanding the metabolism/processing of APP is crucial for AD therapeutics.

In the recent past, proteins from non-immunoglobulins have attracted attention as they mimic antibodies with respect to binding potential and provide further potential advantages. In this regard, we have attempted to explore a three-finger neurotoxin protein (3F). 3F proteins are small (~7 kDa), structurally well defined, thermally stable and resistant to proteolysis that presents them as promising candidates for directed evolution.ResultsWe have engineered a snake α-neurotoxin that belongs to the 3F family by randomizing the residues in the loops involved in binding with acetylcholine receptors and employing cDNA display to obtain modulators of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). Selected candidates were highly specific for IL-6R with dissociation constants and IC50s in the nanomolar range. Antagonists as well as agonists were identified in an IL-6 dependent cell proliferation assay. Size minimization yielded peptides of about one-third the molecular mass of the original proteins, without significant loss of activities and, additionally, lead to the identification of the loops responsible for function.ConclusionsThis study shows 3F protein is amenable to introduce amino acid changes in the loops that enable preparation of a high diversity library that can be utilized to obtain ligands against macromolecules. We believe this is the first report of protein engineering to convert a neurotoxin to receptor ligands other than the parent receptor, the identification of an agonist from non-immunoglobulin proteins, the construction of peptide mimic of IL-6, and the successful size reduction of a single-chain protein.","Phage Display, Directed Evolution, Random Peptide Library, Affinity Selection, cDNA Display",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-4-2,2011

Electrophysiological recordings from E17.5-18.5 spinal cord motoneurons demonstrated that VGAT knockouts presented no spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by GABA and glycine.

Interestingly, ASIC1a interacts with PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase 1), an intracellular protein that regulates trafficking of several membrane proteins. However, whether PICK1 regulates ASIC1a surface expression remains unknown.ResultsHere, we show that PICK1 overexpression increases ASIC1a surface level. A BAR domain mutant of PICK1, which impairs its lipid binding capability, blocks this increase. Lipid binding of PICK1 is also required for PICK1-induced clustering of ASIC1a.

Here we report that a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, nafamostat mesylate (NM), and several of its analogues, block recombinant TRPM7 currents expressed in HEK293T cells in inverse relationship to the concentration of extracellular divalent cations. Lowering extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ also evokes a divalent-sensitive non-selective cation current that is mediated by TRPM7 expression in hippocampal neurons. In cultured hippocampal neurons, NM blocked these TRPM7-mediated currents with an apparent affinity of 27 μM, as well as the paradoxical Ca2+ influx associated with lowering extracellular Ca2+. Unexpectedly, pre-exposure to NM strongly potentiated TRPM7 currents. In the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular divalent cations, NM activates TRPM7. The stimulating effects of NM on TRPM7 currents are also inversely related to extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+. DAPI and HSB but not netropsin, blocked and stimulated TRPM7. In contrast, mono-cationic, the metabolites of NM, p-GBA and AN, as well as protease inhibitor leupeptin and gabexate failed to substantially modulate TRPM7.

There is growing evidence implicating the glutamate system in the pathophysiology and treatment of anxiety disorders, though the molecular mechanism by which the glutamate system regulates anxiety-like behavior remains unclear.ResultsIn this study, we provide evidence suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor, contributes to anxiety-like behavior. The GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated: Tyr-1472 is the major phosphorylation site. Homozygous knock-in mice that express a Tyr-1472-Phe mutant of GluN2B, which prevents phosphorylation of this site, show enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze test. Expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which is important for the regulation of anxiety-like behavior, is increased in the amygdala of the knock-in mice. Furthermore, injection of CRF receptor antagonist attenuated the enhanced anxiety-like behavior of the knock-in mice.

However, it remains unclear whether there is a cell fate switch of Math5-lineage cells in the absence of Math5 and whether MATH5 cell-autonomously regulates the differentiation of the above retinal neurons. Here, we performed a lineage analysis of Math5-expressing cells in developing mouse retinas using a conditional GFP reporter (Z/EG) activated by a Math5-Cre knock-in allele. We show that during normal retinogenesis, Math5-lineage cells mostly develop into RGCs, horizontal cells, cone photoreceptors, rod photoreceptors, and amacrine cells. Interestingly, amacrine cells of Math5-lineage cells are predominately of GABAergic, cholinergic, and A2 subtypes, indicating that Math5 plays a role in amacrine subtype specification. In the absence of Math5, more Math5-lineage cells undergo cell fate conversion from RGCs to the above retinal cell subtypes, and occasionally to cone-bipolar cells and Müller cells. This change in cell fate choices is accompanied by an up-regulation of NEUROD1, RXRγ and BHLHB5, the transcription factors essential for the differentiation of retinal cells other than RGCs. Additionally, loss of Math5 causes the failure of early progenitors to exit cell cycle and leads to a significant increase of Math5-lineage cells remaining in cell cycle.

The degenerative changes were accompanied by a loss of 60-80% of the nigral dopamine neurons and 60-70% reduction in striatal dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels. Dichlorvos exposed animals also showed α -synuclein and ubiquitin positive inclusions along with swollen, dystrophic neurites and mitochondrial abnormalities like decreased complex I&IV activities, increased mitochondrial size, axonal degeneration and presence of electron dense perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusions in the substantia nigra of rats. These animals also showed evidence of oxidative stress, including increased mitochondrial ROS levels, decreased MnSOD activity and increased lipid peroxidation. Measurable impairments in neurobehavioral indices were also observed. Notable exacerbations in motor impairments, open field and catalepsy were also evident in dichlorvos exposed animals.ConclusionAll these findings taken together indicate that chronic dichlorvos exposure may cause nigrostaital neurodegenaration and significant behavioral impairments.","Tyrosine Hydroxylase, Substantia Nigra, Corpus Striatum, Tyrosine Hydroxylase Activity, Dopamine Beta Hydroxylase",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-35,2010

Importantly, recent evidence reveals that expression and activity levels of the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which initiates amyloid-β (Aβ) production, are elevated in AD brains. In this study, we investigated a molecular mechanism by which sex and stress interactions may accelerate β-amyloidogenesis and contribute to sporadic AD.ResultsWe applied 5-day restraint stress (6 h/day) to the male and female 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD at the pre-pathological stage of disease, which showed little amyloid deposition under non-stressed control conditions. Exposure to the relatively brief behavioral stress increased levels of neurotoxic Aβ42 peptides, the β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99) and plaque burden in the hippocampus of female 5XFAD mice but not in that of male 5XFAD mice. In contrast, significant changes in the parameters of β-amyloidosis were not observed in the cerebral cortex of stressed male or female 5XFAD mice. We found that this sex- and brain region-specific acceleration of β-amyloidosis was accounted for by elevations in BACE1 and APP levels in response to adverse stress. Furthermore, not only BACE1 mRNA but also phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (a proposed mediator of the post-transcriptional upregulation of BACE1) was elevated in the hippocampus of stressed female 5XFAD mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the higher prevalence of sporadic AD in women may be attributable to the vulnerability of female brains (especially, the hippocampus) to stressful events, which alter APP processing to favor the β-amyloidogenesis through the transcriptional and translational upregulation of BACE1 combined with elevations in its substrate APP.","Amyloid Precursor Protein, Restraint Stress, Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing, 5XFAD Mouse, Behavioral Stress",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-34,2010

N171-82Q mice that express N-terminal 171 amino acids of htt with an 82-glutamine repeat show severe neurological phenotypes and die early, suggesting that N-terminal mutant htt is pathogenic. In addition, various cellular factors and genetic modifiers are found to modulate the cytotoxicity of mutant htt. Understanding the contribution of these factors to HD pathogenesis will help identify therapeutics for this disease. To investigate the role of interleukin type 1 (IL-1), a cytokine that has been implicated in various neurological diseases, in HD neurological symptoms, we crossed N171-82Q mice to type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) knockout mice. Mice lacking IL-1RI and expressing N171-82Q show more severe neurological symptoms than N171-82Q or IL-1RI knockout mice, suggesting that lack of IL-1RI can promote the neuronal toxicity of mutant htt. Lack of IL-1RI also increases the accumulation of transgenic mutant htt in the striatum in N171-82Q mice.

The connection between human SOX10 mutations and neural crest cell pathogenesis led us to focus on the Sox10 gene, which is critical for neural crest development. We generated Sox10- Venus BAC transgenic mice to monitor Sox10 expression in both normal development and in pathological processes.ResultsTissue fluorescence distinguished neural crest progeny cells and oligodendrocytes in the Sox10- Venus mouse embryo. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that Venus expression was restricted to cells expressing endogenous Sox10. Time-lapse imaging of various tissues in Sox10- Venus mice demonstrated that Venus expression could be visualized at the single-cell level in vivo due to the intense, focused Venus fluorescence. In the adult Sox10- Venus mouse, several types of mature and immature oligodendrocytes along with Schwann cells were clearly labeled with Venus, both before and after spinal cord injury.ConclusionsIn the newly-developed Sox10- Venus transgenic mouse, Venus fluorescence faithfully mirrors endogenous Sox10 expression and allows for in vivo imaging of live cells at the single-cell level. This Sox10- Venus mouse will thus be a useful tool for studying neural crest cells or oligodendrocytes, both in development and in pathological processes.","Bacterial Artificial Chromosome, Neural Crest, Enhance Green Fluorescent Protein, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Clone, Neural Crest Cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-31,2010
"Roles of zinc and metallothionein-3 in oxidative stress-induced lysosomal dysfunction, cell death, and autophagy in neurons and astrocytes","Sook-Jeong Lee2 &, Jae-Young Koh1",Jae-Young Koh,jkko@amc.seoul.kr,2010-10-26,"Zinc dyshomeostasis has been recognized as an important mechanism for cell death in acute brain injury. An increase in the level of free or histochemically reactive zinc in astrocytes and neurons is considered one of the major causes of death of these cells in ischemia and trauma. Although zinc dyshomeostasis can lead to cell death via diverse routes, the major pathway appears to involve oxidative stress.Recently, we found that a rise of zinc in autophagic vacuoles, including autolysosomes, is a prerequisite for lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell death in cultured brain cells exposed to oxidative stress conditions. The source of zinc in this process is likely redox-sensitive zinc-binding proteins such as metallothioneins, which release zinc under oxidative conditions. Of the metallothioneins, metallothionein-3 is especially enriched in the central nervous system, but its physiologic role in this tissue is not well established. Like other metallothioneins, metallothionein-3 may function as metal detoxicant, but is also known to inhibit neurite outgrowth and, sometimes, promote neuronal death, likely by serving as a source of toxic zinc release. In addition, metallothionein-3 regulates lysosomal functions. In the absence of metallothionein-3, there are changes in lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 and -2, and reductions in certain lysosomal enzymes that result in decreased autophagic flux. This may have dual effects on cell survival. In acute oxidative injury, zinc dyshomeostasis and lysosomal membrane permeabilization are diminished in metallothionein-3 null cells, resulting in less cell death. But over the longer term, diminished lysosomal function may lead to the accumulation of abnormal proteins and cause cytotoxicity.The roles of zinc and metallothionein-3 in autophagy and/or lysosomal function have just begun to be investigated. In light of evidence that autophagy and lysosomes may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, further insight into the contribution of zinc dynamics and metallothionein-3 function may help provide ways to effectively regulate these processes in brain cells.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Autophagic Flux, Acute Brain Injury, Lysosomal Function, Intracellular Zinc",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-30,2010
M1 muscarinic receptor for the development of auditory cortical function,"Karalee K Shideler1 &, Jun Yan1",Jun Yan,juyan@ucalgary.ca,2010-10-22,"The sensory cortex is subject to continuous remodelling during early development and throughout adulthood. This process is important for establishing normal brain function and is dependent on cholinergic modulation via muscarinic receptors. Five muscarinic receptor genes encode five unique receptor subtypes (M1-5). The distributions and functions of each subtype vary in central and peripheral systems. In the brain, the M1 receptor is most abundant in the cerebral cortex, where its immunoreactivity peaks transiently during early development. This likely signifies the importance of M1 receptor in the development and maintenance of normal cortical function. Several lines of study have outlined the roles of M1 receptors in the development and plasticity of the auditory cortex. For example, M1-knockout reduces experience-dependent plasticity and disrupts tonotopic mapping in the adult mouse auditory cortex. Further evidence demonstrates a role for M1 in neurite outgrowth and hence determining the structure of cortical neurons. The disruption of tonotopic maps in M1-knockout mice may be linked to alterations in thalamocortical connectivity, because the targets of thalamocortical afferents (layer IV cortical neurons) appear less mature in M1 knockouts. Herein we review the literature to date concerning M1 receptors in the auditory cortex and consider some future directions that will contribute to our understanding.","Neurite Outgrowth, Auditory Cortex, Spiral Ganglion, Spiral Ganglion Neuron, Medial Geniculate Body",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-29,2010

By contrast, the Activin pathway regulates axonal tiling in a contact-independent manner.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV contributes to translation-dependent early synaptic potentiation in the anterior cingulate cortex of adult mice,"Hiroki Toyoda1,4,, Ming-Gao Zhao1,5,, Valentina Mercaldo1,, Tao Chen1,, Giannina Descalzi1,, Satoshi Kida3 &, Min Zhuo1,2",Min Zhuo,min.zhuo@utoronto.ca,2010-09-16,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) phosphorylates the major transcription factor, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which plays key roles in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Our previous study showed that long-term potentiation (LTP) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice overexpressing CaMKIV. Considering that the CaMKIV-CREB pathway plays a central role in the protein synthesis-dependent LTP, it is possible that upregulation of CaMKIV contributes to enhancement of LTP by promoting protein synthesis. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of transcription and translation inhibitors on synaptic potentiation induced by pairing of synaptic activity with postsynaptic depolarization (paired training) in ACC pyramidal neurons of wild-type and CaMKIV transgenic mice. We found that synaptic potentiation induced by paired training was partially inhibited by transcription or translation inhibitors both in wild-type and CaMKIV transgenic mice; the extent of inhibition was markedly larger in the CaMKIV transgenic mice than in the wild-type mice. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies revealed that CaMKIV was distributed in the membrane, cytosol and nucleus of ACC neurons. Our results reveal in the first time a transcription- and translation-dependent component of early synaptic LTP in adult ACC synapses, and demonstrate that CaMKIV enhances early synaptic potentiation by activating new protein synthesis.","Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Paired Training, Synaptic Potentiation, Anterior Cingulate Cortex Neuron, Postsynaptic Depolarization",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-27,2010

During granule cell maturation, the mechanisms that differentiate new cells not only describe the degree of cell differentiation, but also crucially regulate the progression of cell differentiation. Here, we describe a gene, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), whose expression distinguishes stem cells from more differentiated cells among the granule cells of the adult mouse dentate gyrus. The use of markers for proliferation, neural progenitors, and immature and mature granule cells indicated that TDO was expressed in mature cells and in some immature cells. In mice heterozygous for the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, in which dentate gyrus granule cells fail to mature normally, TDO immunoreactivity was substantially downregulated in the dentate gyrus granule cells. Moreover, a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling experiment revealed that new neurons began to express TDO between 2 and 4 wk after the neurons were generated, when the axons and dendrites of the granule cells developed and synaptogenesis occurred. These findings indicate that TDO might be required at a late-stage of granule cell development, such as during axonal and dendritic growth, synaptogenesis and its maturation.","Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Granule Cell, Dentate Gyrus, Kynurenine, Adult Neurogenesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-26,2010

Recent data suggest that D2Rs form dimers in-vitro and in-vivo, and we hypothesized that schizophrenia, as well as preclinical models of schizophrenia, would demonstrate altered dimerization of D2Rs, even though the overall number of D2Rs was unaltered.MethodsWe measured the expression of D2Rs dimers and monomers in patients with schizophrenia using Western blots, and then in striatal tissue from rats exhibiting the amphetamine-induced sensitized state (AISS). We further examined the interaction between D2Rs and the dopamine transporter (DAT) by co-immunoprecipitation, and measured the expression of dopamine D2High receptors with ligand binding assays in rat striatum slices with or without acute amphetamine pre-treatment.ResultsWe observed significantly enhanced expression of D2Rs dimers (277.7 ± 33.6%) and decreased expression of D2Rs monomers in post-mortem striatal tissue of schizophrenia patients. We found that amphetamine facilitated D2Rs dimerization in both the striatum of AISS rats and in rat striatal neurons. Furthermore, amphetamine-induced D2Rs dimerization may be associated with the D2R-DAT protein-protein interaction as an interfering peptide that disrupts the D2R-DAT coupling, blocked amphetamine-induced up-regulation of D2Rs dimerization.ConclusionsGiven the fact that amphetamine induces psychosis and that the AISS rat is a widely accepted animal model of psychosis, our data suggest that D2R dimerization may be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may be a promising new target for novel antipsychotic drugs.","Schizophrenia, Amphetamine, Schizophrenia Patient, HEK293T Cell, Domperidone",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-25,2010

Intermediate term memory (ITM) that persists for up to 3 h requires new protein synthesis. Long term memory (LTM) that persists for at least 24 h requires: DNA transcription, RNA translation, and the trafficking of newly synthesized proteins. It has been shown in a number of different model systems that NMDA receptors, protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) are all involved in the memory formation process.ResultsHere we show that snails trained in control conditions are capable of forming, depending on the training procedure used, either ITM or LTM. However, blockage of NMDA receptors (MK 801), inhibition of PKC (GF109203X hydrochloride) and MAPK activity (UO126) prevent the formation of both ITM and LTM.ConclusionsThe injection of either U0126 or GF109203X, which inhibit MAPK and PKC activity respectively, 1 hour prior to training results in the inhibition of both ITM and LTM formation.

Forced expression of KChIP1 in cultured hippocampal neurons increased the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), reduced paired pulse facilitation of autaptic IPSCs, and decreases potassium current density. Furthermore, genetic ablation of KChIP1 potentiated potassium current density in neurons and caused a robust enhancement of anxiety-like behavior in mice.

Here, we show that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) transactivation by the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) is not dependent on ligands for PDGFRβ. Furthermore, when PDGFRβ dimerization is inhibited and receptor phosphorylation is suppressed to near basal levels, the receptor maintains its ability to be transactivated and is still effective in signaling to ERK1/2. Hence, the DRD4-PDGFRβ-ERK1/2 pathway can occur independently of a PDGF-like ligand, PDGFRβ cross-phosphorylation and dimerization, which is distinct from other known forms of transactivation of RTKs by GPCRs.","Dopamine, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, Tyrosine Phosphorylation, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Transactivation, Paracrine Mediator",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-22,2010

Consequently, few studies have addressed the cellular function(s) of full-length htt and its dysfunction(s) associated with the disease.ResultsWe describe a flexible synthetic vector encoding full-length htt called pARIS-htt (A daptable, R NAi I nsensitive & S ynthetic). It includes synthetic cDNA coding for full-length human htt modified so that: 1) it is improved for codon usage, 2) it is insensitive to four different siRNAs allowing gene replacement studies, 3) it contains unique restriction sites (URSs) dispersed throughout the entire sequence without modifying the translated amino acid sequence, 4) it contains multiple cloning sites at the N and C-ter ends and 5) it is Gateway compatible. These modifications facilitate mutagenesis, tagging and cloning into diverse expression plasmids. Htt regulates dynein/dynactin-dependent trafficking of vesicles, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-containing vesicles, and of organelles, including reforming and maintenance of the Golgi near the cell centre. We used tests of these trafficking functions to validate various pARIS-htt constructs. We demonstrated, after silencing of endogenous htt, that full-length htt expressed from pARIS-htt rescues Golgi apparatus reformation following reversible microtubule disruption. A mutant form of htt that contains a 100Q expansion and a htt form devoid of either HAP1 or dynein interaction domains are both unable to rescue loss of endogenous htt. These mutants have also an impaired capacity to promote BDNF vesicular trafficking in neuronal cells.ConclusionWe report the validation of a synthetic gene encoding full-length htt protein that will facilitate analyses of its structure/function.

Like other prion disorders such a sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease of humans and Mad Cow Disease of cattle, CWD is caused by PrP-scrapie (PrPSc), a β-sheet rich isoform of a normal cell surface glycoprotein, the prion protein (PrPC). Since PrPSc is sufficient to cause infection and neurotoxicity if ingested by a susceptible host, it is important to understand the mechanism by which it crosses the stringent epithelial cell barrier of the small intestine. Possible mechanisms include co-transport with ferritin in ingested food and uptake by dendritic cells. Since ferritin is ubiquitously expressed and shares considerable homology among species, co-transport of PrPSc with ferritin can result in cross-species spread with deleterious consequences. We have used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models of intestinal epithelial cell barrier to understand the role of ferritin in mediating PrPSc uptake and transport. In this report, we demonstrate that PrPSc and ferritin from CWD affected deer and elk brains and scrapie from sheep resist degradation by digestive enzymes, and are transcytosed across a tight monolayer of human epithelial cells with significant efficiency. Likewise, ferritin from hamster brains is taken up by mouse intestinal epithelial cells in vivo, indicating that uptake of ferritin is not limited by species differences as described for prions. More importantly, the iron content of ferritin determines its efficiency of uptake and transport by Caco-2 cells and mouse models, providing insight into the mechanism(s) of ferritin and PrPSc uptake by intestinal epithelial cells.","Ferritin, Brain Homogenate, Scrapie, Chronic Wasting Disease, Scrapie Infected Mouse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-14,2010

We found that the enhancement of cell survival by HFS was exclusively restricted to the specific narrow period during immature stages of new neurons (7-10 days after birth). Furthermore, the pharmacological blockade of LTP induction suppressed the enhancement of cell survival by the HFS. These results suggest that the LTP induction within a narrow critical period of immature stages enhances the survival of newly generated neurons in rat DG.","Dentate Gyrus, Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus, Population Spike Amplitude, BrdU Injection, Adult Dentate Gyrus",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-13,2010
Astrocytic expression of Parkinson's disease-related A53T α-synuclein causes neurodegeneration in mice,"Xing-Long Gu1,, Cai-Xia Long1,, Lixin Sun1,, Chengsong Xie1,, Xian Lin1 &, Huaibin Cai1",Huaibin Cai,caih@mail.nih.gov,2010-04-21,"BackgroundParkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder. While neuronal deposition of α-synuclein serves as a pathological hallmark of PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, α-synuclein-positive protein aggregates are also present in astrocytes. The pathological consequence of astrocytic accumulation of α-synuclein, however, is unclear.ResultsHere we show that PD-related A53T mutant α-synuclein, when selectively expressed in astrocytes, induced rapidly progressed paralysis in mice. Increasing accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates was found in presymptomatic and symptomatic mouse brains and correlated with the expansion of reactive astrogliosis. The normal function of astrocytes was compromised as evidenced by cerebral microhemorrhage and down-regulation of astrocytic glutamate transporters, which also led to increased inflammatory responses and microglial activation. Interestingly, the activation of microglia was mainly detected in the midbrain, brainstem and spinal cord, where a significant loss of dopaminergic and motor neurons was observed. Consistent with the activation of microglia, the expression level of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) was significantly up-regulated in the brain of symptomatic mice and in cultured microglia treated with conditioned medium derived from astrocytes over-expressing A53T α-synuclein. Consequently, the suppression of COX-1 activities extended the survival of mutant mice, suggesting that excess inflammatory responses elicited by reactive astrocytes may contribute to the degeneration of neurons.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate a critical involvement of astrocytic α-synuclein in initiating the non-cell autonomous killing of neurons, suggesting the viability of reactive astrocytes and microglia as potential therapeutic targets for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.","Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Multiple System Atrophy, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Expression, Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter, Midbrain Dopaminergic Neuron",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-12,2010

Although this has been shown to occur after endocytosis of APP from the cell surface, the exact compartments of APP processing are not well defined. We have previously demonstrated that APP and γ-secretase proteins and activity are highly enriched in purified rat liver lysosomes. In order to examine the lysosomal distribution and trafficking of APP in cultured cells, we generated constructs containing APP fused to a C-terminal fluorescent protein tag and N-terminal HA-epitope tag. These were co-transfected with a panel of fluorescent-protein tagged compartment markers.ResultsHere we demonstrate using laser-scanning confocal microscopy that although APP is present throughout the endosomal/lysosomal system in transfected Cos7 and neuronal SN56 cell lines as well as in immunostained cultured mouse neurons, it is enriched in the lysosome. We also show that the Swedish and London mutations reduce the amount of APP in the lysosome. Surprisingly, in addition to its expected trafficking from the cell surface to the early and then late endosomes, we find that cell-surface labelled APP is transported rapidly and directly from the cell surface to lysosomes in both Cos7 and SN56 cells. This rapid transit to the lysosome is blocked by the presence of either the London or Swedish mutations.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the presence of a novel, rapid and specific transport pathway from the cell surface to the lysosomes. This suggests that regulation of lysosomal traffic could regulate APP processing and that the lysosome could play a central role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.","Amyloid Precursor Protein, Early Endosome, Late Endosome, Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing, Supplemental Movie",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-11,2010
Inhibition of AMPA receptor trafficking at hippocampal synapses by β-amyloid oligomers: the mitochondrial contribution,"Yanfang Rui1,, Jiaping Gu1,, Kuai Yu1,, H Criss Hartzell1 &, James Q Zheng1",James Q Zheng,james.zheng@emory.edu,2010-03-26,"BackgroundSynaptic defects represent a major mechanism underlying altered brain functions of patients suffering Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1–3]. An increasing body of work indicates that the oligomeric forms of β-amyloid (Aβ) molecules exert profound inhibition on synaptic functions and can cause a significant loss of neurotransmitter receptors from the postsynaptic surface, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated a potential contribution of mitochondria to Aβ inhibition of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking.ResultsWe found that a brief exposure of hippocampal neurons to Aβ oligomers not only led to marked removal of AMPARs from postsynaptic surface but also impaired rapid AMPAR insertion during chemically-induced synaptic potentiation. We also found that Aβ oligomers exerted acute impairment of fast mitochondrial transport, as well as mitochondrial translocation into dendritic spines in response to repetitive membrane depolarization. Quantitative analyses at the single spine level showed a positive correlation between spine-mitochondria association and the surface accumulation of AMPARs. In particular, we found that spines associated with mitochondria tended to be more resistant to Aβ inhibition on AMPAR trafficking. Finally, we showed that inhibition of GSK3β alleviated Aβ impairment of mitochondrial transport, and effectively abolished Aβ-induced AMPAR loss and inhibition of AMPAR insertion at spines during cLTP.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that mitochondrial association with dendritic spines may play an important role in supporting AMPAR presence on or trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane. Aβ disruption of mitochondrial trafficking could contribute to AMPAR removal and trafficking defects leading to synaptic inhibition.","Dendritic Spine, Mitochondrial Transport, Dendritic Shaft, Synaptic Potentiation, Mitochondrial Translocation",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-10,2010

Long-term memory (LTM) formation requires: DNA transcription, RNA translation, and the trafficking of newly synthesized proteins. Several components of these processes have already been identified. However, due to the complexity of the memory formation process, there likely remain many yet to be identified proteins involved in memory formation and persistence.ResultsHere we use a quantitative proteomic method to identify novel memory-associated proteins in neural tissue taken from animals that were trained in vivo to form a long-term memory. We identified 8 proteins that were significantly up-regulated, and 13 that were significantly down-regulated in the LTM trained animals as compared to two different control groups. In addition we found 19 proteins unique to the trained animals, and 12 unique proteins found only in the control animals.ConclusionsThese results both confirm the involvement of previously identified memory proteins such as: protein kinase C (PKC), adenylate cyclase (AC), and proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.

We coexpressed wild type Gβ1γ2 subunits with either wild type or point mutant N-type calcium channels, and voltage-dependent, G protein-mediated inhibition of the channels (VDI) was assessed using patch clamp recordings. The resulting data indicate that Arg376 and Val416 of the α1 subunit, residues which are surface-exposed in the presence of the calcium channel β subunit, contribute significantly to the functional inhibition by Gβ1.

The lack of convenient means for real-time determination of the stages of differentiation of individual neural cells, however, has been hindering progress in elucidating the mechanisms. In order to be able to easily identify the stages of differentiation of neural cells, we have been attempting to establish a mouse system that would allow progression of neuronal differentiation to be visualized based on transitions between fluorescence colors by using a combination of mouse genetics and the ever-expanding repertoire of fluorescent proteins. In this study we report the initial version of such a mouse system, which we call ""Color Timer."" We first generated transgenic (Tg; nestin/KOr Tg) mice in which production of the fluorescent protein Kusabira-Orange (KOr) is controlled by the gene regulatory elements within the 2nd intronic enhancer of the nestin gene, which is a good marker for NSCs, so that NSCs would emit orange fluorescence upon excitation. We then confirmed by immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical analyses that the KOr fluorescence closely reflected the presence of the Nestin protein. We also confirmed by a neurosphere formation assay that the intensity of the KOr fluorescence correlated with ""stemness"" of the cell and it was possible to readily identify NSCs in the two neurogenic regions, namely the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, in the brain of adult nestin/KOr Tg mice by the orange fluorescence they emitted. We then crossed nestin/KOr mice with doublecortin-enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Tg mice, whose immature neurons emit green fluorescence upon excitation, and it was possible to visualize the progress of NSC-to-neuron differentiation by the transition between fluorescence colors from orange to green.

This results in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the activation of protein kinase C. The activation of Group I mGluRs also results in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We show here, that the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) interacts with both mGluR1 and mGluR5 and is precipitated with both receptors from rat brain. Pyk2 also interacts with GST-fusion proteins corresponding to the second intracellular loop and the distal carboxyl-terminal tail domains of mGluR1a. Pyk2 colocalizes with mGluR1a at the plasma membrane in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and with endogenous mGluR5 in cortical neurons. Pyk2 overexpression in HEK293 results in attenuated basal and agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in mGluR1 expressing cells and involves a mechanism whereby Pyk2 displaces Gαq/11 from the receptor. The activation of endogenous mGluR1 in primary mouse cortical neuron stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treatments that prevent Pyk2 phosphorylation in cortical neurons, and the overexpression of Pyk2 dominant-negative and catalytically inactive Pyk2 mutants in HEK293 cells, prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The Pyk2 mediated activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is also Src-, calmodulin- and protein kinase C-dependent.

Disruption of RBP-J at early retinogenesis resulted in accelerated RPCs differentiation, but only photoreceptors and ganglion cells were overrepresented, with other neuronal populations diminished. Similarly, deletion of RBP-J at early postnatal days also led to overproduction of photoreceptors, suggesting that RBP-J governed RPCs specification and differentiation through retinogenesis.

However, CBP/p300 repressed CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcription in NIH3T3 cells and knockdown of CBP or p300 expression by siRNA enhanced this transcription.

There is currently no treatment to prevent the neurodegeneration caused by this devastating disorder. Huntingtin has been shown to be a positive regulator of vesicular transport, particularly for neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This function is lost in patients with HD, resulting in a decrease in neurotrophic support and subsequent neuronal death. One promising line of treatment is therefore the restoration of huntingtin function in BDNF transport.ResultsThe phosphorylation of huntingtin at serine 421 (S421) restores its function in axonal transport. We therefore investigated whether inhibition of calcineurin, the bona fide huntingtin S421 phosphatase, restored the transport defects observed in HD. We found that pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 led to sustained phosphorylation of mutant huntingtin at S421. FK506 restored BDNF transport in two complementary models: rat primary neuronal cultures expressing mutant huntingtin and mouse cortical neurons from HdhQ111/Q111 HD knock-in mice. This effect was the result of specific calcineurin inhibition, as calcineurin silencing restored both anterograde and retrograde transport in neurons from HdhQ111/Q111 mice. We also observed a specific increase in calcineurin activity in the brain of HdhQ111/Q111 mice potentially accounting for the selective loss of huntingtin phosphorylation and contributing to neuronal cell death in HD.ConclusionOur results validate calcineurin as a target for the treatment of HD and provide the first demonstration of the restoration of huntingtin function by an FDA-approved compound.","Mutant Huntingtin, Calcineurin Activity, Transport Defect, FK506 Treatment, Total Phosphatase Activity",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-33,2009

Previous anatomic studies suggest complex local interactions among neurons within the ACC. However, there is a lack of functional studies of such synaptic connections between ACC neurons. In the present study, we characterized the neuronal connections in the superficial layers (I-III) of the mouse ACC using dual whole-cell patch clamp recording technique. Four types of synaptic connections were observed, which are from a pyramidal neuron to a pyramidal neuron, from a pyramidal neuron to an interneuron, from an interneuron to a pyramidal neuron and from an interneuron to an interneuron. These connections exist among neurons in layer II/III or between neurons located layer I and II/III, respectively. Moreover, reciprocal connections exist in all four types of paired neurons.

We also examined whether phospho-ERK was regulated by redox signaling mechanisms and found that increases in active ERK induced by Aβ and nicotine were blocked by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase.ConclusionOur findings indicate that NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling is required for Aβ-induced activation of ERK, and suggest a similar mechanism may occur during early stages of Alzheimer's disease.","Nicotine, NADPH Oxidase, Pyramidal Neuron, Nanomolar Concentration, Nicotine Treatment",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-31,2009

In diseased neurons, TDP-43 is depleted in the nucleus, suggesting a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism. However, the normal function of TDP-43 in postmitotic neurons is largely unknown.ResultsHere we demonstrate that overexpression of Drosophila TDP-43 (dTDP-43) in vivo significantly increases dendritic branching of sensory neurons in Drosophila larvae. Loss of dTDP-43 function, either in a genetic null mutant or through RNAi knockdown, decreased dendritic branching. Further genetic analysis demonstrated a cell-autonomous role for dTDP-43 in dendrite formation. Moreover, human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) promoted dendritic branching in Drosophila neurons, and this function was attenuated by mutations associated with ALS.ConclusionThese findings reveal an essential role for TDP-43 in dendritic structural integrity, supporting the notion that loss of normal TDP-43 function in diseased neurons may compromise neuronal connectivity before neuronal cell loss in FTD and ALS.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Sensory Neuron, Frontotemporal Dementia, Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Postmitotic Neuron",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-30,2009

Despite significant advances in the identification of genetic mutations and signaling pathways that are associated with the disease, the precise mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease are not well understood. More importantly, treatments that are effective in reversing the progression of the disease is essentially lacking. Further investigation into the pathogenic mechanisms of PD thus presents a pressing concern for neuroscientists. Recently, deregulation of the autophagic pathway is observed in the brains of PD patients and in models of PD.

However, the dominance of this clock has been challenged by the observations that metabolic duress can over-ride SCN controlled rhythms, and that clock genes are expressed in many brain areas, including those implicated in the regulation of appetite and feeding. The recent development of mice in which clock gene/protein activity is reported by bioluminescent constructs (luciferase or luc) now enables us to track molecular oscillations in numerous tissues ex vivo. Consequently we determined both clock activities and responsiveness to metabolic perturbations of cells and tissues within the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), a site pivotal for optimal internal homeostatic regulation.ResultsHere we demonstrate endogenous circadian rhythms of PER2::LUC expression in discrete subdivisions of the arcuate (Arc) and dorsomedial nuclei (DMH). Rhythms resolved to single cells did not maintain long-term synchrony with one-another, leading to a damping of oscillations at both cell and tissue levels. Complementary electrophysiology recordings revealed rhythms in neuronal activity in the Arc and DMH. Further, PER2::LUC rhythms were detected in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle and in the median eminence/pars tuberalis (ME/PT). A high-fat diet had no effect on the molecular oscillations in the MBH, whereas food deprivation resulted in an altered phase in the ME/PT.ConclusionOur results provide the first single cell resolution of endogenous circadian rhythms in clock gene expression in any intact tissue outside the SCN, reveal the cellular basis for tissue level damping in extra-SCN oscillators and demonstrate that an oscillator in the ME/PT is responsive to changes in metabolism.","Slice Culture, Clock Gene Expression, Mediobasal Hypothalamus, PER2 Expression, Endogenous Circadian Rhythm",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-28,2009

Western blot analyses demonstrated that these BDNF variants are poorly cleaved and result in the predominant secretion of proBDNF. Using these cleavage-resistant proBDNF (CR-proBDNF) variants, the molecular and cellular roles of proBDNF on the CNS neurons were examined. First, CR-proBDNF showed normal intracellular distribution and secretion in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that inhibition of proBDNF cleavage does not affect intracellular transportation and secretion of BDNF. Second, we purified recombinant CR-proBDNF and tested its biological effects using cultured CNS neurons. Treatment with CR-proBDNF elicited apoptosis of cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), while treatment with mature BDNF (matBDNF) promoted cell survival. Third, we examined the effects of CR-proBDNF on neuronal morphology using more than 2-week cultures of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, in marked contrast to the action of matBDNF, which increased the number of cholinergic fibers and hippocampal dendritic spines, CR-proBDNF dramatically reduced the number of cholinergic fibers and hippocampal dendritic spines, without affecting the survival of these neurons.ConclusionThese results suggest that proBDNF has distinct functions in different populations of CNS neurons and might be responsible for specific physiological cellular processes in the brain.","Hippocampal Neuron, Spine Density, Dendritic Spine, Cerebellar Granule Neuron, Dendritic Spine Density",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-27,2009

SERTs are not only targets for exogenous addictive and therapeutic agents but also can be modulated by endogenous, receptor-linked signaling pathways. We have shown that neuronal A3 adenosine receptor activation leads to enhanced presynaptic 5-HT transport in vitro and an increased rate of SERT-mediated 5-HT clearance in vivo. SERT stimulation by A3 adenosine receptors derives from an elevation of cGMP and subsequent activation of both cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. PKG activators such as 8-Br-cGMP are known to lead to transporter phosphorylation, though how this modification supports SERT regulation is unclear.ResultsIn this report, we explore the kinase isoform specificity underlying the rapid stimulation of SERT activity by PKG activators. Using immortalized, rat serotonergic raphe neurons (RN46A) previously shown to support 8-Br-cGMP stimulation of SERT surface trafficking, we document expression of PKGI, and to a lower extent, PKGII. Quantitative analysis of staining profiles using permeabilized or nonpermeabilized conditions reveals that SERT colocalizes with PKGI in both intracellular and cell surface domains of RN46A cell bodies, and exhibits a more restricted, intracellular pattern of colocalization in neuritic processes. In the same cells, SERT demonstrates a lack of colocalization with PKGII in either intracellular or surface membranes. In keeping with the ability of the membrane permeant kinase inhibitor DT-2 to block 8-Br-cGMP stimulation of SERT, we found that DT-2 treatment eliminated cGMP-dependent kinase activity in PKGI-immunoreactive extracts resolved by liquid chromatography. Similarly, treatment of SERT-transfected HeLa cells with small interfering RNAs targeting endogenous PKGI eliminated 8-Br-cGMP-induced regulation of SERT activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that, in transporter/kinase co-transfected cells, PKGIα specifically associates with hSERT.ConclusionOur findings provide evidence of a physical and compartmentalized association between SERT and PKGIα that supports rapid, 8-Br-cGMP-induced regulation of SERT. We discuss a model wherein SERT-associated PKGIα supports sequentially the mobilization of intracellular transporter-containing vesicles, leading to enhanced surface expression, and the production of catalytic-modulatory SERT phosphorylation, leading to a maximal enhancement of 5-HT clearance capacity.","Adenosine Receptor Activation, SERT Expression, SERT Activity, Nonpermeabilized Condition, RN46A Cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-26,2009
Basic mechanisms for recognition and transport of synaptic cargos,"Max A Schlager1 &, Casper C Hoogenraad1",Casper C Hoogenraad,c.hoogenraad@erasmusmc.nl,2009-08-04,"Synaptic cargo trafficking is essential for synapse formation, function and plasticity. In order to transport synaptic cargo, such as synaptic vesicle precursors, mitochondria, neurotransmitter receptors and signaling proteins to their site of action, neurons make use of molecular motor proteins. These motors operate on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton and are highly regulated so that different cargos can be transported to distinct synaptic specializations at both pre- and post-synaptic sites. How synaptic cargos achieve specificity, directionality and timing of transport is a developing area of investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that the docking of motors to their cargos is a key control point. Moreover, precise spatial and temporal regulation of motor-cargo interactions is important for transport specificity and cargo recruitment. Local signaling pathways - Ca2+ influx, CaMKII signaling and Rab GTPase activity - regulate motor activity and cargo release at synaptic locations. We discuss here how different motors recognize their synaptic cargo and how motor-cargo interactions are regulated by neuronal activity.","AMPA Receptor, Dendritic Spine, Motor Protein, Myosin Versus, Cargo Transport",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-25,2009

Degeneration of Purkinje cells is a common feature of inherited ataxias in humans and mice. To understand Purkinje neuron degeneration, investigators have turned to naturally occurring Purkinje cell degeneration phenotypes in mice to identify key regulatory proteins and cellular pathways. The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse is a recessive mutant characterized by complete and dramatic post-natal, cell autonomous Purkinje neuron degeneration and death. As the basis of Purkinje cell death in pcd is unresolved, and contradictory data has emerged for the role of autophagy in Purkinje cell degeneration, we studied the mechanism of Purkinje cell death in pcd mice. BAX null status did not suppress Purkinje neuron death in pcd mice, indicating that classic apoptosis is not responsible for Purkinje cell loss. Interestingly, LC3 Western blot analysis and GFP-LC3 immunostaining of degenerating pcd cerebellum revealed activation of the autophagy pathway. Ultrastructural studies confirmed increased autophagy pathway activity in Purkinje cells, and yielded evidence for mitophagy, in agreement with LC3 immunoblotting of cerebellar fractions. As p62 levels were decreased in pcd cerebellum, our findings suggest that pcd Purkinje cell neurons can execute effective autophagy. However, our results support a role for dysregulated autophagy activation in pcd, and suggest that increased or aberrant mitophagy contributes to the Purkinje cell degeneration in pcd mice.","Purkinje Cell, Purkinje Neuron, Autophagy Pathway, Autophagy Activation, Homozygous Mouse",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-24,2009

Multiple lines of alsin knockout (ALS2-/-) mice have been generated to model this disease. However, it remains elusive whether the Rab5-dependent endocytosis is altered in ALS2-/- neurons. To directly examine the Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking in ALS2-/- neurons, we introduced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rab5 into cultured hippocampal neurons to monitor the morphology and motility of Rab5-associated early endosomes. Here we report that Rab5-mediated endocytosis was severely altered in ALS2-/-neurons. Excessive accumulation of Rab5-positive vesicles was observed in ALS2-/- neurons, which correlated with a significant reduction in endosomal motility and augmentation in endosomal conversion to lysosomes. Consequently, a significant increase in endosome/lysosome-dependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in ALS2-/- neurons. These phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of Rab5 in wild-type neurons. Therefore, our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism of alsin in Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking, suggesting that enhanced endosomal degradation in ALS2-/- neurons may underlie the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration in ALS2 and related motor neuron diseases.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Early Endosome, Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, Motor Neuron Degeneration, ALS2 Gene",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-23,2009

However, the detailed mechanism and influences underlying epileptic disorders are still unrevealed. The hippocampal neurons are vulnerable to epilepsy-induced pathologic changes and often manifests as neuronal death. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of maternal epileptic seizure on apoptotic neuronal death, modulation of GABAB1 receptor (R), and protein kinase A-α (PKA) in prenatal rat hippocampal neurons at gestational days (GD) 17.5. Seizure was induced in pregnant rat using intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (40 mg/kg for 15 days). To confirm the seizure electroencephalography (EEG) data was obtained by the Laxtha EEG-monitoring device in the EEG recording room and EEG were monitored 5 min and 15 min after PTZ injection. The RT-PCR and Western blot results showed significant increased expression of cytochrome-c and caspases-3, while decreased levels of GABAB1R, and PKA protein expression upon ethanol, PTZ and ethanol plus PTZ exposure in primary neuronal cells cultured from PTZ-induced seizure model as compare to non-PTZ treated maternal group. Apoptotic neurodegeneration was further confirmed with Fluoro-Jade B and propidium iodide staining, where neurons were scattered and shrunken, with markedly condensed nuclei in PTZ treated group compared with control. This study for the first time indicate that PTZ-induced seizures triggered activation of caspases-3 to induce widespread apoptotic neuronal death and decreased GABAB1R expression in hippocampal neurons, providing a possible mechanistic link between maternal epilepsy induced neurodegeneration alteration of GABAB1R and PKA expression level during prenatal brain development. This revealed new aspects of PTZ and ethanol's modulation on GABAB1R, learning and memory.

Mice with targeted disruption of the nNOS gene exhibit abnormal behaviors. Here, we subjected nNOS knockout (KO) mice to a battery of behavioral tests to further investigate the role of nNOS in neuropsychiatric functions. We also examined the role of nNOS in dopamine/DARPP-32 signaling in striatal slices from nNOS KO mice and the effects of the administration of a dopamine D1 receptor agonist on behavior in nNOS KO mice.ResultsnNOS KO mice showed hyperlocomotor activity in a novel environment, increased social interaction in their home cage, decreased depression-related behavior, and impaired spatial memory retention.

The underlying signalling mechanism is not fully understood.ResultsIn the established adult rat NSC culture, FGF-2 promotes self-renewal by increasing proliferation and inhibiting spontaneous differentiation of adult NSCs, accompanied with activation of MAPK and PLC pathways. Using a molecular genetic approach, we demonstrate that activation of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), largely through two key cytoplasmic amino acid residues that are linked to MAPK and PLC activation, suffices to promote adult NSC self-renewal.

Samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, after elution from a reverse phase C18 column by a gradient of acetonitrile.ResultsWe first demonstrate in vitro that PREP digests biological active alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH1–13), by cleaving the terminal amidated valine and releasing a truncated alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH1–12) product – the 12 residues α-MSH form. We then use the technique in vivo to analyze the MRM transitions of the three different forms of α-MSH: the deacetylated α-MSH1–13, the acetylated α-MSH1–13 and the truncated form α-MSH1–12. For this experiment, we used a mouse model (PREP-GT) in which the serine protease, prolyl endopeptidase, is deficient due to a genetrap insertion. Here we report that the ratio between acetylated α-MSH1–13 and α-MSH1–12 is significantly increased (P-value = 0.015, N = 6) in the pituitaries of PREP-GT mice when compared to wild type littermates. In addition no significant changes were revealed in the relative level of α-MSH1–13 versus the deacetylated α-MSH1–13. These results combined with the demonstration that PREP digests α-MSH1–13in vitro, strongly suggest that α-MSH1–13 is an in vivo substrate of PREP.ConclusionThe multiplex targeted quantitative peptidomics technique we present in this study will be decidedly useful to monitor several neuropeptide enzymatic reactions in vivo under varying conditions.","Multiple Reaction Monitoring, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Transition, Melanocortin Receptor, Congenic Mouse, Prolyl Endopeptidase",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-14,2009

Protein synthesis is essential not only for consolidation but also for maintenance and post-retrieval reconsolidation of acrobatic motor skill in rats,"Ji-Yun Peng1 &, Bao-Ming Li1,2",Bao-Ming Li,bmli@fudan.edu.cn,2009-05-28,"It has been reported that consolidation of motor skill, a type of non-declarative memories, requires protein synthesis, as hippocampus-dependent declarative memory does. However, little is known about the importance of protein synthesis in maintenance and especially post-retrieval reconsolidation of acrobatic motor skill. Here, we show that protein synthesis is essential not only for the consolidation but also for the maintenance and reconsolidation of a rotarod-running skill. Intra-ventricle infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin 0 h but not 2 h post-training caused a severe deficit in the acquisition of the rotarod-running skill. Protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) also caused a deficit in the maintenance of the rotarod-running skill, as well-trained rats demonstrated a deficit in the rotarod-running performance upon treatment with anisomycin. Similarly, PSI impaired the post-retrieval reconsolidation of the rotarod-running skill: well-trained rats treated with anisomycin 0 h but not 0.5, 2 and 4 h after the task performance exhibited amnesia for the running skill later on. Interestingly, rats treated with anisomycin 6 and 12 h post-retrieval exhibited amnesia for the running skill. Thus, protein synthesis is essential not only for the consolidation but also for the maintenance and post-retrieval reconsolidation of rotarod-running acrobatic motor skill.","Motor Skill, Protein Synthesis Inhibition, Guide Cannula, Retention Trial, Require Protein Synthesis",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-12,2009

Considering the fact that laboratory grown animals live in an artificial comfort environment, we wondered if NMDA receptor functions and its related LTP would differ in animals living in a natural wild environment. In this report we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from both laboratory wild-type mice and wild mice from a natural environment. We found that LTP was significantly enhanced in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the wild mice as compared with that of laboratory mice. In parallel, NMDA receptor NR2B/total NMDA receptor mediated EPSC ratio was significantly increased in slices of wild mice.

Previous studies have revealed that the DAT carboxyl terminus (DAT-CT) can directly interact with other cellular proteins and regulate DAT function and trafficking.ResultsHere, we have identified that carboxypeptidase E (CPE), a prohormone processing exopeptidase and sorting receptor for the regulated secretory pathway, interacts with the DAT-CT and affects DAT function. Mammalian cell lines coexpressing CPE and DAT exhibited increased DAT-mediated dopamine uptake activity compared to cells expressing DAT alone. Moreover, coexpression of an interfering DAT-CT minigene inhibited the effects of CPE on DAT. Functional changes caused by CPE could be attributed to enhanced DAT expression and subsequent increase in DAT cell surface localization, due to decreased DAT degradation. In addition, CPE association could reduce the phosphorylation state of DAT on serine residues, potentially leading to reduced internalization, thus stabilizing plasmalemmal DAT localization.ConclusionTaken together, our results reveal a novel role for CPE in the regulation of DAT trafficking and DAT-mediated DA uptake, which may provide a novel target in the treatment of dopamine-governed diseases such as drug addiction and obesity.","Cell Surface Localization, Sorting Receptor, Translocation Velocity, Nonpermeabilized Condition, Carboxyl Terminus Tail",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-2-10,2009

The short form of Vesl (Vesl-1S) is an alternatively spliced isoform of the vesl-1 gene, which also encodes the long form of the Vesl protein (Vesl-1L). Vesl-1L is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein that binds to and modulates the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 (mGluR1/5), the IP3 receptor, and the ryanodine receptor. Vesl-1 null mutant mice show abnormal behavior, which includes anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, and an increase in cocaine-induced locomotion; however, the function of the short form of Vesl in behavior is poorly understood because of the lack of short-form-specific knockout mice.ResultsIn this study, we generated short-form-specific gene targeting (KO) mice by knocking in part of vesl-1L/homer-1c cDNA. Homozygous KO mice exhibited normal spine number and morphology. Using the contextual fear conditioning test, we demonstrated that memory acquisition and short-term memory were normal in homozygous KO mice. In contrast, these mice showed impairment in fear memory consolidation. Furthermore, the process from recent to remote memory was affected in homozygous KO mice. Interestingly, reactivation of previously consolidated fear memory attenuated the conditioning-induced freezing response in homozygous KO mice, which suggests that the short form plays a role in fear memory reconsolidation.

These findings indicated that alpha-CaMKII is important not only for learning and memory but also for emotional behaviors. In this study, to understand the roles of alpha-CaMKII in emotional behavior, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing alpha-CaMKII in the forebrain and analyzed their behavioral phenotypes.ResultsWe generated transgenic mice overexpressing alpha-CaMKII in the forebrain under the control of the alpha-CaMKII promoter. In contrast to alpha-CaMKII (+/-) heterozygous knockout mice, alpha-CaMKII overexpressing mice display an increase in anxiety-like behaviors in open field, elevated zero maze, light-dark transition and social interaction tests, and a decrease in locomotor activity in their home cages and novel environments; these phenotypes were the opposite to those observed in alpha-CaMKII (+/-) heterozygous knockout mice.

To date, few enzymes have been examined for their ability to degrade aSyn. Here, we explore the effects of CTSD gene expression, which encodes the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (CathD), on aSyn processing.ResultsOver-expression of human CTSD cDNA in dopaminergic MES23.5 cell cultures induced the marked proteolysis of exogenously expressed aSyn proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, brain extractions, Western blotting and ELISA quantification revealed evidence for reduced levels of soluble endogenous aSyn in ctsd knock-out mice. However, these CathD-deficient mice also contained elevated levels of insoluble, oligomeric aSyn species, as detected by formic acid extraction. In accordance, immunohistochemical studies of ctsd-mutant brain from mice, sheep and humans revealed selective synucleinopathy-like changes that varied slightly among the three species. These changes included intracellular aSyn accumulation and formation of ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Furthermore, using an established Drosophila model of human synucleinopathy, we observed markedly enhanced retinal toxicity in ctsd-null flies.ConclusionWe conclude from these complementary investigations that: one, CathD can effectively degrade excess aSyn in dopaminergic cells; two, ctsd gene mutations result in a lysosomal storage disorder that includes microscopic and biochemical evidence of aSyn misprocessing; and three, CathD deficiency facilitates aSyn toxicity.

The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim was to investigate the toxicity and modulation of NF-κB activity by cocaine in PC 12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, cellular membrane rupture and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p50/p65 subunit of NF-κB complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-κB in PC12 cells.

Mossy fiber paths and synapses are primarily restricted to the stratum lucidum within the CA3 region. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin family protein that activates Trk neurotrophin receptors, is highly expressed in the stratum lucidum in an activity-dependent manner. The addition of a Trk neurotrophin receptor inhibitor, K252a, to cultured hippocampal slices induced aberrant extension of mossy fibers into ectopic regions. BDNF overexpression in granule cells ameliorated the mossy fiber pathway abnormalities caused by a submaximal dose of K252a. A similar rescue was observed when BDNF was expressed in CA3 pyramidal cells, most notably in mossy fibers distal to the expression site. These findings are the first to clarify the role of BDNF in mossy fiber pathfinding, not as an attractant cue but as a regulator, possibly acting in a paracrine manner. This effect of BDNF may be as a signal for new fibers to fasciculate and extend further to form synapses with neurons that are far from active BDNF-expressing synapses.

PDGF receptor ligand is also neuroprotective in hippocampal slices and cultured neurons. PDGF receptors are tyrosine kinases that control a variety of signal transduction pathways including those mediated by PLCγ. In fibroblasts Src and another non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Abelson kinase (Abl), control PDGF receptor regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. The mechanism whereby PDGF receptor regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in central neurons remains poorly understood.ResultsIntracellular applications of active Abl, but not heat-inactivated Abl, decreased NMDA-evoked currents in isolated hippocampal neurons. This mimics the effects of PDGF receptor activation in these neurons. The Abl kinase inhibitor, STI571, blocked the inhibition of NMDA currents by Abl. We demonstrate that PDGF receptors can activate Abl kinase in hippocampal neurons via mechanisms similar to those observed previously in fibroblasts. Furthermore, PDGFβ receptor activation alters the subcellular localization of Abl. Abl kinase is linked to actin cytoskeletal dynamics in many systems. We show that the inhibition of NMDA receptor currents by Abl kinase is blocked by the inclusion of the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, and that activation of Abl correlates with an increase in ROCK tyrosine phosphorylation.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that PDGFβ receptors act via an interaction with Abl kinase and Rho kinase to regulated cytoskeletal regulation of NMDA receptor channels in CA1 pyramidal neurons.","NMDA Receptor, Hippocampal Neuron, Hippocampal Slice, PDGF Receptor, Rock Inhibitor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-20,2008

This interaction permits the daily rhythm of sleep and wake, regulated in parallel by circadian cues originating from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and arousal-promoting signals arising from the orexin-containing neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus (TH). Intriguingly, the SCN circadian clock can be reset by arousal-promoting stimuli while activation of orexin/hypocretin neurons is believed to be under circadian control, suggesting the existence of a reciprocal relationship. Unfortunately, since orexin neurons are themselves activated by locomotor promoting cues, it is unclear how these two systems interact to regulate behavioral rhythms. Here mice were placed in conditions of constant light, which suppressed locomotor activity, but also revealed a highly pronounced circadian pattern in orexin neuronal activation. Significantly, activation of orexin neurons in the medial and lateral TH occurred prior to the onset of sustained wheel-running activity. Moreover, exposure to a 6 h dark pulse during the subjective day, a stimulus that promotes arousal and phase advances behavioral rhythms, activated neurons in the medial and lateral TH including those containing orexin. Concurrently, this stimulus suppressed SCN activity while activating cells in the median raphe. In contrast, dark pulse exposure during the subjective night did not reset SCN-controlled behavioral rhythms and caused a transient suppression of neuronal activation in the TH. Collectively these results demonstrate, for the first time, pronounced circadian control of orexin neuron activation and implicate recruitment of orexin cells in dark pulse resetting of the SCN circadian clock.","Syrian Hamster, Circadian Time, Circadian Cycle, Orexin Neuron, Subjective Night",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-19,2008

To investigate mechanisms for α-syn accumulation and toxicity, we studied a mouse model of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D (CD) deficiency, and found extensive accumulation of endogenous α-syn in neurons without overabundance of α-syn mRNA. In addition to impaired macroautophagy, CD deficiency reduced proteasome activity, suggesting an essential role for lysosomal CD function in regulating multiple proteolytic pathways that are important for α-syn metabolism. Conversely, CD overexpression reduces α-syn aggregation and is neuroprotective against α-syn overexpression-induced cell death in vitro. In a C. elegans model, CD deficiency exacerbates α-syn accumulation while its overexpression is protective against α-syn-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Mutated CD with diminished enzymatic activity or overexpression of cathepsins B (CB) or L (CL) is not protective in the worm model, indicating a unique requirement for enzymatically active CD. Our data identify a conserved CD function in α-syn degradation and identify CD as a novel target for LB disease therapeutics.","Lewy Body, Dementia With Lewy Body, Proteasome Activity, Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Human Neuroblastoma SHSY5Y Cell",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-17,2008

To investigate the structural and functional properties of the ifenprodil binding domain on the NR2B protein, we have purified a soluble recombinant rat NR2B protein fragment comprising the first ~400 amino acid amino-terminal domain (ATD2B) expressed in E. coli. Spectral measurements on refolded ATD2B protein demonstrated specific binding to ifenprodil. We have used site-directed mutagenesis, circular dichroism spectroscopy and molecular modeling to obtain structural information on the interactions between critical amino acid residues and ifenprodil of our soluble refolded ATD2B proteins. Ligand-induced changes in protein structure were inferred from changes in the circular dichroism spectrum, and the concentration dependence of these changes was used to determine binding constants for ifenprodil and its analogues.ResultsLigand binding of ifenprodil, RO25,6981 and haloperidol on soluble recombinant ATD2B determined from circular dichroism spectroscopy yielded low-to-high micromolar equilibrium constants which concurred with functional IC50 measurement determined in heterologously expressed NR1/NR2B receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Amino acid residue substitutions of Asp101, Ile150 and Phe176 with alanine residue within the ATD2B protein altered the recombinant protein dissociation constants for ifenprodil, mirroring the pattern of their functional phenotypes. Molecular modeling of ATD2B as a clam-shell-like structure places these critical residues near a putative ligand binding site.ConclusionWe report for the first time biochemical measurements show that the functional measurements actually reflect binding to the ATD of NR2B subunit.

Quantification of gamma-secretase modulation differentiates inhibitor compound selectivity between two substrates Notch and amyloid precursor protein,"Ting Yang1,, Dilyara Arslanova1,, Yongli Gu1,, Corinne Augelli-Szafran1 &, Weiming Xia1",Weiming Xia,wxia@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,2008-11-04,"BackgroundDeposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is generated from γ-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to APP, γ-secretase also cleaves other type I integral membrane proteins, including the Notch receptor, a key molecule involved in embryonic development.ResultsTo explore selective γ-secretase inhibitors, a combination of five methods was used to systematically determine these inhibitors' profiles on the γ-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch. When two potent γ-secretase inhibitors, compound E (cpd E) and DAPT, were used in a conventional in vitro γ-secretase activity assay, cpd E completely blocked Aβ generation from the cleavage of substrate APP C100, but only had a minor effect on Notch cleavage and NICD generation. Next, cpd E and DAPT were applied to HEK293 cells expressing a truncated Notch substrate NotchΔE. Both cpd E and DAPT were more potent in blocking Aβ generation than NICD generation. Third, a reporter construct was created that carried the NICD targeting promoter with three Su(H) binding sequences followed by the luciferase gene. We found that the inhibition of NICD generation by cpd E and DAPT was consistent with the reduced expression of luciferase gene driven by this Notch targeting promoter. Fourth, levels of ""Notch-Aβ-like"" (Nβ*) peptide derived from two previously reported chimeric APP with its transmembrane domain or the juxtamembrane portion replaced by the Notch sequence were quantified. Measurement of Nβ* peptides by ELISA confirmed that EC50's of cpd E were much higher for Nβ* than Aβ. Finally, the expression levels of Notch target gene her6 in cpd E or DAPT-treated zebrafish were correlated with the degree of tail curvature due to defective somitogenesis, a well characterized Notch phenotype in zebrafish.ConclusionOur ELISA-based quantification of Aβ and Nβ* in combination with the test in zebrafish provides a novel approach for efficient cell-based screening and in vivo validation of APP selective γ-secretase inhibitors.","Notch Signaling, Amyloid Precursor Protein, Notch Target Gene, Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleavage, Notch Cleavage",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-15,2008

However, the lack of effective and selective blockers has hindered the study of these channels, mostly due to the lack of good assay system. Here, we have developed a reliable drug screening method for better blockers of CaCCs, using the endogeneous CaCCs in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) technique.ResultsOocytes were prepared with a treatment of Ca2+ ionophore, which was followed by a treatment of thapsigargin which depletes Ca2+ stores to eliminate any contribution of Ca2+ release. TEVC was performed with micropipette containing chelerythrine to prevent PKC dependent run-up or run-down. Under these conditions, Ca2+-activated Cl- currents induced by bath application of Ca2+ to oocytes showed stable peak amplitude when repetitively activated, allowing us to test several concentrations of a test compound from one oocyte. Inhibitory activities of commercially available blockers and synthesized anthranilic acid derivatives were tested using this method. As a result, newly synthesized N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)anthranilic acid with trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) at para position on the benzene ring showed the lowest IC50.ConclusionOur results provide an optimal drug screening strategy suitable for high throughput screening, and propose N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)anthranilic acid as an improved CaCC blocker.","Xenopus Oocyte, Para Position, Thapsigargin, Drug Screening, Mefenamic Acid",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-14,2008

This kind of reversal of synaptic strength is termed as depotentiation and may have a function to increase the flexibility and storage capacity of neuronal networks. Our previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in extracellular levels of adenosine and subsequent activation of adenosine A1 receptors are important for the induction of depotentiation; however, the signaling downstream of adenosine A1 receptors to mediate depotentiation induction remains elusive.ResultsWe confirm that depotentiation induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) (2 Hz, 10 min, 1200 pulses) was dependent on adenosine A1 receptor activation, because it was mimicked by bath-applied adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and was inhibited by the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). Pretreatment of the hippocampal slices with the selective p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl]-5-(4-pyrudyl)-1H-imidazole (SB203580) or trans-1-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-(fluorophenyl)-5-(2-methoxypyrimidin-4-yl)imidazole (SB239063), prevented the induction of depotentiation by LFS and CPA. In agreement with electrophysiological observation, both LFS- and CPA-induced depotentiation are associated with an increase in p38 MAPK activation, which are blocked by DPCPX or SB203580 application.ConclusionThese results suggest that activation of adenosine A1 receptor and in turn triggering p38 MAPK signaling may contribute to the LFS-induced depotentiation at hippocampal CA1 synapses.","AMPA Receptor, Hippocampal Slice, mGlu Receptor, Control Slice, Surface AMPA Receptor",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-13,2008

The cytosolic cytochrome c activated caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and the increased caspase-3 activity was observed following a 3 hr dieldrin exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, dieldrin caused the caspase-dependent proteolytic cleavage of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) into 41 kDa catalytic and 38 kDa regulatory subunits in N27 cells as well as in brain slices. PKCδ plays a critical role in executing the apoptotic process in dieldrin-treated dopaminergic neuronal cells because pretreatment with the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin, or transfection and over-expression of catalytically inactive PKCδK376R, significantly attenuates dieldrin-induced DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation.ConclusionTogether, we conclude that caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation of PKCδ is a critical event in dieldrin-induced apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neuronal cells.","PC12 Cell, Endosulfan, Dieldrin, Dopaminergic Neuronal Cell, Cyclodiene Insecticide",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-12,2008

The dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1: dysbindin-1) gene is a major susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Genetic variations in DTNBP1 are associated with cognitive functions, general cognitive ability and memory function, and clinical features of patients with schizophrenia including negative symptoms and cognitive decline. Since reduced expression of dysbindin-1 has been observed in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia, the sandy (sdy) mouse, which has a deletion in the Dtnbp1 gene and expresses no dysbindin-1 protein, could be an animal model of schizophrenia. To address this issue, we have carried out a comprehensive behavioral analysis of the sdy mouse in this study.ResultsIn a rotarod test, sdy mice did not exhibit motor learning whilst the wild type mice did. In a Barnes circular maze test both sdy mice and wild type mice learned to selectively locate the escape hole during the course of the training period and in the probe trial conducted 24 hours after last training. However, sdy mice did not locate the correct hole in the retention probe tests 7 days after the last training trial, whereas wild type mice did, indicating impaired long-term memory retention. A T-maze forced alternation task, a task of working memory, revealed no effect of training in sdy mice despite the obvious effect of training in wild type mice, suggesting a working memory deficit.ConclusionSdy mouse showed impaired long-term memory retention and working memory. Since genetic variation in DTNBP1 is associated with both schizophrenia and memory function, and memory function is compromised in patients with schizophrenia, the sdy mouse may represent a useful animal model to investigate the mechanisms of memory dysfunction in the disorder.","Schizophrenia, Wild Type Mouse, Dentate Gyrus, Open Field Test, Mossy Fiber",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-11,2008

Here we show that MAG, a RGD tri-peptide containing protein, forms a complex with β1-integrin to mediate axonal growth cone turning responses of several neuronal types. Mutations that alter the RGD motif in MAG or inhibition of β1-integrin function, but not removal of NgRs, abolish these MAG-dependent events. In contrast, OMgp-induced repulsion is not affected by inhibition of b1-integrin function. We further show that MAG stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which in turn is required for MAG-induced growth cone turning.

The identification and investigation of clinical endophenotypes may be one solution, but represents a considerable challenge in human subjects. Here we report that mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alpha-CaMKII+/-) have profoundly dysregulated behaviours and impaired neuronal development in the dentate gyrus (DG). The behavioral abnormalities include a severe working memory deficit and an exaggerated infradian rhythm, which are similar to symptoms seen in schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus of these mutants revealed that the expression levels of more than 2000 genes were significantly changed. Strikingly, among the 20 most downregulated genes, 5 had highly selective expression in the DG. Whereas BrdU incorporated cells in the mutant mouse DG was increased by more than 50 percent, the number of mature neurons in the DG was dramatically decreased. Morphological and physiological features of the DG neurons in the mutants were strikingly similar to those of immature DG neurons in normal rodents. Moreover, c-Fos expression in the DG after electric footshock was almost completely and selectively abolished in the mutants. Statistical clustering of human post-mortem brains using 10 genes differentially-expressed in the mutant mice were used to classify individuals into two clusters, one of which contained 16 of 18 schizophrenic patients. Nearly half of the differentially-expressed probes in the schizophrenia-enriched cluster encoded genes that are involved in neurogenesis or in neuronal migration/maturation, including calbindin, a marker for mature DG neurons.

On the cellular level, transcriptional regulation is thought to be the starting point for a series of molecular steps necessary for both the initiation and maintenance of long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF). The core molecular features of transcriptional regulation involved in the long-term process are evolutionally conserved in Aplysia, Drosophila, and mouse, and indicate that gene regulation by the c yclic AMP r esponse e lement b inding protein (CREB) acting in conjunction with different combinations of transcriptional factors is critical for the expression of many forms of long-term memory. In the marine snail Aplysia, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the storage of long-term memory have been extensively studied in the monosynaptic connections between identified sensory neuron and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. One tail shock or one pulse of serotonin (5-HT), a modulatory transmitter released by tail shocks, produces a transient facilitation mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase leading to covalent modifications in the sensory neurons that results in an enhancement of transmitter release and a strengthening of synaptic connections lasting minutes. By contrast, repeated pulses of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induce a transcription- and translation-dependent long-term facilitation (LTF) lasting more than 24 h and trigger the activation of a family of transcription factors in the presynaptic sensory neurons including ApCREB1, ApCREB2 and ApC/EBP. In addition, we have recently identified novel transcription factors that modulate the expression of ApC/EBP and also are critically involved in LTF.

In this study, Ro 256981, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B, was used to reduce the expression of analgesic tolerance to morphine. The mechanisms altered with chronic drug use share similarities with those underlying the establishment of long-tem potentiation (LTP) and behavioral memory. Since NMDA NR2B receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play roles in the establishment of LTP and fear memory, we explored their role in changes that occur in this region after chronic morphine. Both systemic and intra-ACC inhibition of NR2B in morphine-tolerant animals inhibited the expression of analgesic tolerance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a significant increase in the NR2B component of NMDA receptor mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), at both synaptic and extra-synaptic sites. However, there was no change in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor mediated EPSCs.
