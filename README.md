# Web Scraping using R: Extracting and Analyzing Journal Article Data

This **Molecular Brain Journal Web Scraper** course project of DS-636 is an R-based project designed to extract, clean, and analyze article data from the *Molecular Brain* journals.  
It enables users to retrieve research metadata such as titles, authors, abstracts, and keywords for articles published in a given year, and visualize key insights such as keyword frequency.

## Features

- Scrape articles from the *Molecular Brain* journals based on a user-specified year.
- Extract essential metadata: Title, Authors, Corresponding Author & Email, Publish Date, Abstract, and Keywords.
- Clean and preprocess the data for consistency and readability.
- Visualize the most frequently used keywords in a bar chart using `ggplot2`.
- Export cleaned data and charts for reporting and presentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: R
- **Web Scraping**: rvest, httr, xml2
- **Data Cleaning & Manipulation**: dplyr, stringr, tidyverse, lubridate
- **Visualization**: ggplot2
- **Data Export**: readr (write_csv)

## Prerequisites
